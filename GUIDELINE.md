- Before-After: Show vulnerable vs. secure code
- Do-Don't: Contrast good vs. bad practices
- If-Then: Conditional guidance based on context

#### Code Examples

Code Example Best Practices:

```markdown
### Secure Implementation Example

Good: Secure password hashing with PBKDF2
```java
public String hashPassword(String password, String salt) {
    PBEKeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(
        password.toCharArray(),
        salt.getBytes(),
        100000,  // iterations
        256      // key length
    );
    // Implementation details...
}
```

Bad: Weak password hashing

```java
public String hashPassword(String password) {
    return DigestUtils.md5Hex(password); // Vulnerable!
}
```

Code Example Guidelines:

- Language-Specific: Provide examples in relevant languages
- Complete: Include all necessary imports and context
- Tested: Ensure examples work as intended
- Commented: Explain key security concepts
- Realistic: Use realistic but safe examples

#### **Configuration Examples**

Configuration Example Format:

### Security Configuration

Apache Security Headers

```apache
# Security headers configuration
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
```

Nginx Security Headers

```nginx
# Security headers configuration
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
```

#### **Diagrams & Visuals**

Visual Content Types:

- Flow Diagrams: Attack vectors and defense mechanisms
- Architecture Diagrams: System security architecture
- Decision Trees: Security decision-making processes
- Checklists: Implementation verification steps

Visual Guidelines:

- Clear & Simple: Avoid overly complex diagrams
- Consistent Style: Use consistent colors and symbols
- Accessible: Ensure diagrams are understandable
- Relevant: Only include visuals that add value

### 3.3 Content Organization Patterns

#### Problem-Solution Pattern

Structure:

1. Problem Statement: What security issue are we addressing?
2. Impact Analysis: What are the consequences?
3. Root Cause: Why does this vulnerability exist?
4. Solution Approach: How do we prevent/fix it?
5. Implementation: Step-by-step guidance
6. Verification: How do we know it's secure?

Example:

```markdown
## SQL Injection Prevention

### The Problem
SQL injection allows attackers to execute malicious SQL commands through application inputs.

### Impact
- Unauthorized data access
- Data manipulation or deletion
- Complete system compromise

### Root Cause
Applications directly concatenate user input into SQL queries without proper validation.

### Solution
Use parameterized queries to separate data from SQL commands.

### Implementation
[Code examples and step-by-step guide]

### Verification
[Testing methods and validation checklist]
```

#### Defense-in-Depth Pattern

Structure:

1. Network Layer: Network-level protections
2. Application Layer: Application-level controls
3. Data Layer: Data protection measures
4. Monitoring Layer: Detection and response

Example:

```markdown
## Defense in Depth for Web Applications

### Network Layer
- Firewall configuration
- Load balancer security
- DDoS protection

### Application Layer
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Authentication & authorization

### Data Layer
- Database security
- Encryption at rest
- Backup security

### Monitoring Layer
- Logging and monitoring
- Intrusion detection
- Incident response
```

#### Lifecycle Pattern

Structure:

1. Design Phase: Security considerations during design
2. Development Phase: Secure coding practices
3. Testing Phase: Security testing approaches
4. Deployment Phase: Secure deployment practices
5. Maintenance Phase: Ongoing security maintenance
