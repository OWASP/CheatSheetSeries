# Security Definitions Cheat Sheet

## Purpose

Provide clear definitions for key security terms used in OWASP Cheat Sheets.

---

## Terms

### Secure by Default

A design principle where systems are configured to be secure out-of-the-box, minimizing the need for manual configuration to achieve security.

### Least Privilege

Users and systems are granted only the minimum access rights necessary to perform their tasks.

### Defense-in-Depth

A layered security approach where multiple controls are implemented to protect an organizationâ€™s assets.

### Fail Securely

A system design principle ensuring that, in the event of an error or failure, the system defaults to a safe state that protects sensitive data.

### Transparency / Observability

The ability to monitor, log, and audit system actions and decisions for accountability and detection of anomalies.

### Resilience and Recovery

The capability of a system to continue functioning under attack or after a failure, and to recover to a secure state.

### Zero Trust

A security model assuming no entity (user, device, or network) is trusted by default and must be continuously verified.

### Security Leadership and Culture

An organizational approach that emphasizes security awareness, training, and commitment from leadership to enforce secure design principles.

### Continuous Improvement

The practice of regularly reviewing, updating, and improving security controls and processes based on lessons learned and evolving threats.

### Input Validation

The process of verifying that data provided to a system is correct, complete, and of the expected type, format, and length.

### Authentication & Authorization

Mechanisms to verify user identity (authentication) and enforce access rights (authorization).

### Encryption

The use of algorithms to protect data in transit or at rest, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

### Secure Configuration

The process of setting up systems and software to follow security best practices, minimizing vulnerabilities and exposure.
