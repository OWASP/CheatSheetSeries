<h1>What is ReactiveUI?</h1>

<a href="https://reactiveui.net/">ReactiveUI</a> is a composable, cross-platform model-view-viewmodel framework for all .NET platforms that is inspired by functional reactive programming which is a paradigm that allows you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HwEytvngXk">abstract mutable state away from your user interfaces and express the idea around a feature in one readable place</a> and improve the testability of your application.

<h2>Book</h2>
There has been an excellent <a href="https://kent-boogaart.com/you-i-and-reactiveui/">book</a> written by our Alumni maintainer Kent Boogart.
 
<h2>Introduction to Reactive Programming</h2>

Long ago, when computer programming first came to be, machines had to be programmed quite manually. If the technician entered the correct sequence of machine codes in the correct order, then the resulting program behavior would satisfy the business requirements. Instead of telling a computer how to do its job, which error-prone and relies too heavily on the infallibility of the programmer, why don't we just tell it what it's job is and let it figure the rest out?

ReactiveUI is inspired by the paradigm of Functional Reactive Programming, which allows you to model user input as a function that changes over time. This is super cool because it allows you to abstract mutable state away from your user interfaces and express the idea around a feature in one readable place whilst improving application testability. Reactive programming can look scary and complex at first glance, but the best way to describe reactive programming is to think of a spreadsheet:

![](https://reactiveui.net/docs/frp-excel.gif)

* Three cells, A, B, and C.
* C is defined as the sum of A and B.
* Whenever A or B changes, C reacts to update itself.

That's reactive programming: changes propagate throughout a system automatically. Welcome to the peanut butter and jelly of programming paradigms. For further information please watch the this video from the Xamarin Evolve conference - [Why You Should Be Building Better Mobile Apps with Reactive Programming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYEbUF4xs1Q) by Michael Stonis.

<h2>NuGet Packages</h2>

Install the following packages to start building your own ReactiveUI app. <b>Note:</b> some of the platform-specific packages are required. This means your app won't perform as expected until you install the packages properly. See the <a href="https://reactiveui.net/docs/getting-started/installation/">Installation</a> docs page for more info.

<h2>A Compelling Example</h2>

Let‚Äôs say you have a text field, and whenever the user types something into it, you want to make a network request which searches for that query.

![](http://i.giphy.com/xTka02wR2HiFOFACoE.gif)

```csharp
public interface ISearchViewModel
{
    string SearchQuery { get; set; }	 
    ReactiveCommand<string, IEnumerable<SearchResult>> Search { get; }
    IEnumerable<SearchResult> SearchResults { get; }
}
```

<h3>Define under what conditions a network request will be made</h3>

We're describing here, in a *declarative way*, the conditions in which the Search command is enabled. Now our Command IsEnabled is perfectly efficient, because we're only updating the UI in the scenario when it should change.

```csharp
var canSearch = this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.SearchQuery, query => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(query));
```

<h3>Make the network connection</h3>

ReactiveCommand has built-in support for background operations and guarantees that this block will only run exactly once at a time, and that the CanExecute will auto-disable and that property IsExecuting will be set accordingly whilst it is running.

```csharp
Search = ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask(_ => searchService.Search(this.SearchQuery), canSearch);
```

<h3>Update the user interface</h3>

ReactiveCommands are themselves `IObservables`, whose values are the results from the async method, guaranteed to arrive on the UI thread. We're going to take the list of search results that the background operation loaded, and turn them into our SearchResults property declared as [`ObservableAsPropertyHelper<T>`](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/oaph/#example).

```csharp
_searchResults = Search.ToProperty(this, x => x.SearchResults);
```

<h3>Handling failures</h3>

Any exception thrown from the [`ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask`](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/commands/) gets piped to the `ThrownExceptions` Observable. Subscribing to this allows you to handle errors on the UI thread.

```csharp
Search.ThrownExceptions.Subscribe(error => { /* Handle exceptions. */ });
```

<h3>Throttling network requests and automatic search execution behaviour</h3>

Whenever the Search query changes, we're going to wait for one second of "dead airtime", then automatically invoke the subscribe command.

```csharp
this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.SearchQuery)
    .Throttle(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), RxApp.MainThreadScheduler)
    .InvokeCommand(Search);
```

<h3>Binding our ViewModel to the platform-specific UI</h3>

ReactiveUI fully supports XAML markup bindings, but we have more to offer. [ReactiveUI Bindings](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/data-binding/) work on **all platforms**, including Xamarin Native and Windows Forms, and operate the same. Those bindings are strongly typed, and renaming a ViewModel property, or a control in the UI layout without updating the binding, the build will fail.

```csharp
this.WhenActivated(cleanup => 
{
    this.Bind(ViewModel, x => x.SearchQuery, x => x.TextBox)
        .DisposeWith(cleanup);
    this.OneWayBind(ViewModel, x => x.SearchResults, x => x.ListView)
        .DisposeWith(cleanup);
    this.BindCommand(ViewModel, x => x.Search, x => x.Button)
        .DisposeWith(cleanup);
});
```

<h3>Forget about INotifyPropertyChanged boilerplate code</h3>

[ReactiveUI.Fody](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReactiveUI.Fody/) package allows you to decorate read-write properties with `Reactive` attribute ‚Äî and code responsible for property change notifications will get injected into your property setters automatically at compile time. We use [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody) tooling to make this magic work.

```csharp
public class ReactiveViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
    [Reactive] 
    public string SearchQuery { get; set; }
}
```

The code above gets compiled into the following code:

```csharp
public class ReactiveViewModel : ReactiveObject
{
    private string searchQuery;
    public string SearchQuery 
    {
        get => searchQuery;
        set => this.RaiseAndSetIfChanged(ref searchQuery, value);
    }
}
```

<h3>Validate user input on the fly</h3>

[ReactiveUI.Validation](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI.Validation) provides a subset of functions to create validations, functioning in a reactive way. For those ViewModels which need validation, implement `ISupportsValidation`, then add validation rules to the ViewModel and finally bind to the validation rules in the View! See [documentation](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/user-input-validation/) for more info. This package was created based on [jcmm33 work](https://github.com/jcmm33/ReactiveUI.Validation) and maintained by [alexmartinezm](https://github.com/alexmartinezm).

```csharp
// # ViewModel
// Search query must not be empty. The selector is the property 
// name and the line below is a single property validator.
this.ValidationRule(
    vm => vm.SearchQuery,
    query => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(query),
    "Please, provide a non-empty search query!");

// # View
// Bind any validations which reference the SearchQuery property 
// to the text of the QueryValidation UI control!
this.BindValidation(ViewModel, vm => vm.SearchQuery, view => view.QueryValidation.Text);
```

<h3>Add view model-based routing to your XAML views</h3>

View model-based routing is supported for Xamarin.Forms, WinRT, UWP, Windows Forms, WPF and Avalonia Desktop applications. Create an [`IScreen`](https://reactiveui.net/api/reactiveui/iscreen/), register views for view models and navigate to your [`IRoutableViewModel`](https://reactiveui.net/api/reactiveui/iroutableviewmodel/)s by calling `Router.Navigate`. Then, bind the [`RoutingState`](https://reactiveui.net/api/reactiveui/routingstate/) to the platform-specific routed view host. See [routing documentation](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/routing/) for a getting started guide.

```xml
<rxui:ReactiveWindow
    xmlns:rxui="http://reactiveui.net" 
    x:Class="ReactiveRouting.MainWindow"
    x:TypeArguments="vm:MainViewModel"
    xmlns:vm="clr-namespace:ReactiveRouting"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">
    <rxui:RoutedViewHost
        Router="{Binding Router}"
        HorizontalContentAlignment="Stretch"
        VerticalContentAlignment="Stretch" />
</rxui:ReactiveWindow>
```
