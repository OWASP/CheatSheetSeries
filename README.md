* [Jim Manico](https://github.com/jmanico).

# Core team

**Any GitHub member is free to add a comment on any Proposal (issue) or PR.**

However, we have created an official core team (core commiters) in order to:
* Review all PR/Proposal in a consistent/regular way using [GitHub's review feature](https://help.github.com/en/articles/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request).
* Extend the field of technologies known by the review team.
* Allow several technical opinions on a Proposal/PR, all exchanges are public because we use the GitHub comment feature.

Decision of the core team have the same weight than the projet leaders, so, if a core team member reject a PR (*rejection must be technically documented and explained*) then project leaders will apply the global decision.

Members:
* [Elie Saad](https://github.com/ThunderSon).
* [Jakub Maćkowski](https://github.com/mackowski).
* [Dominique Righetto](https://github.com/righettod).
* [Jim Manico](https://github.com/jmanico).

# PR usage for core commiters

For the following kind of modifications, the PR system will be used by the core commiters in order to allow peer review using the GitHub PR review system:
* Addition of a new cheat sheet.
* Deep modification of an existing cheat sheet.

Below are the steps to properly submit a PR:
1. Clone the project.
2. Move on to the `master` branch: 
    > `git checkout master`
3. Ensure that you have the latest files:
    > `git pull`
4. Create a branch named `CSS-[ID]` where **[ID]** is the number of the linked issue opened prior to the PR to follow the contribution process:
    > `git checkout -b CSS-[ID]`
5. Switch to this new branch (normally it's already the case):
    > `git checkout CSS-[ID]`
6. Do the expected work.
7. Push the new branch:
    > `git push origin CSS-[ID]`   
8. When the work is ready for the review, create a pull request by visiting this link:
    > `https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/pull/new/CSS-[ID]`
9. Implement the modifications requested by the reviewers. Once the reviewers approve the PR, it is then merged to the `master` branch.
10. Once merged, delete the branch using this [GitHub feature](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#deleting-a-branch).

See project current [branches](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/branches).

# Project logo

Project's official logo files are hosted [here](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-swag/tree/master/projects/cheat-sheet-series).

# Folders

**cheatsheets_excluded**:
* Contains the cheat sheets markdown files converted with PANDOC and for which a discussion must be made in order to decide if we include them into the V2 of the project due to the content has not been updated since a long time or is not relevant anymore. See this [discussion](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/issues/13). 

**cheatsheets**: 
* Contains the final cheat sheets files. 
* Any `.md` file present into this folder is considered released.

**assets**: 
* Contains the assets used by the cheat sheets (images, pdf, zip...).
    * Naming convention is `[CHEAT_CHEET_MARKDOWN_FILE_NAME]_[IDENTIFIER].[EXTENSION]`
    * Use `PNG` format for the images.

**scripts**:
* Contains all the utility scripts used to operate the project (markdown linter audit, dead link identification...).    

**templates**:
* Contains templates used for different kinds of files (cheatsheet...).

**.github**:
* Contains materials used to configure different behaviors of GitHub.

**.circleci** / **.travis.yml** (file):
* Contains the definition of the integration jobs used to control the integrity and consistency of the whole project:
    * **[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries)** is used to perform compliance check actions at each Push/Pull Request. **It must be/stay the fastest possible** (currently inferior to 2 minutes) in order to provide a rapid compliance feedback about the Push/Pull Request.
    * **[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries)** is used to perform operations taking *longer time* like build, publish and deploy actions.

# Offline website

Unfortunately, a PDF file generation is not possible because the content is cut in some cheat sheets like for example the abuse case one.

However, to propose the possibility the consult, in a full offline mode, the collection of all cheat sheets, a script to generate a offline site using [GitBook](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/) has been created. The script is [here](scripts/Generate_Site.sh).

* **book.json**: Gitbook configuration file.
* **Preface.md**: Project preface description applied on the generated site.

## Automated build

This [link](https://owasp.github.io/CheatSheetSeries/bundle.zip) allow you to download a build (zip archive) of the offline website.

## Manual build

Use the commands below to generate the site:

```bash
# Your python version must be >= 3.5
$ python --version
Python 3.5.3
# Dependencies:
#  sudo apt install -y nodejs
#  sudo npm install gitbook-cli -g
$ cd scripts
$ bash Generate_Site.sh
Generate a offline portable website with all the cheat sheets...
Step 1/5: Init work folder.
Step 2/5: Generate the summary markdown page.
Index updated.
Summary markdown page generated.
Step 3/5: Create the expected GitBook folder structure.
Step 4/5: Generate the site.
info: found 45 pages
info: found 86 asset files
info: >> generation finished with success in 14.2s !
Step 5/5: Cleanup.
Generation finished to the folder: ../generated/site
$ cd ../generated/site/
$ ls -l

# Conversion rules

* Use the markdown syntax described in this [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Use this [sheet](https://gist.github.com/molomby/9bc092e4a125f529ae362de7e46e8176) for Superscript and Subscript characters.
* Use this [sheet](https://meta.askubuntu.com/a/7383) for Arrows (left, right, top, down) characters.
* Store all assets in the **assets** folder and use the following syntax:
    * `![ALTERNATE_NAME](../assets/ASSET_NAME.png)` for the insertion of an image. Use `PNG` format for the images (this [software](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) can be used to handle format conversion).
    * `[ALTERNATE_NAME](../assets/ASSET_NAME.EXT)` for the insertion of other kinds of media (pdf, zip...).
* Use ATX style (`#` syntax) for section head. 
* Use `**bold**` syntax for **bold** text.
* Use `*italic*` syntax for *italic* text.
* Use `TAB` for nested lists and not spaces.
* Use [code fencing syntax along syntax highlighting](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for code snippet (prevent when possible horizontal scrollbar).
* If you use `{{` or `}}` pattern in code fencing then add a space between the both curly braces (ex: `{ {`) otherwise it break GitBook generation process.
* Same remark about the cheat sheet file name, only the following syntax is allowed: `[a-zA-Z_]+`.
* No HTML code is allowed, only markdown syntax is allowed!
* Use this [site](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for generation of tables.
* Use a single new line between a section head and the beginning of its content.

# Editor & validation policy

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is used for the work on the markdown files. It is also used for the work on the scripts.

The file **Project.code-workspace** is the workspace file in order to open the project in VSCode.

The following [plugin](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint) is used to validate the markdown content.

The file **.markdownlint.json** define the central validation policy applied at VSCode (IDE) and TravisCI (CI) levels.

Details about rules is [here](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/master/doc/Rules.md).

The file **.markdownlinkcheck.json** define the configuration used to validate using this [tool](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check), at TravisCI level, all web and relatives links used in cheat sheets.
