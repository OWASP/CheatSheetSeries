# CISA Secure by Design Cheat Sheet

## Introduction

CISAâ€™s Secure by Design principles provide a global baseline for building secure software and systems. Following these principles helps developers and architects reduce risk, protect sensitive data, and integrate security into the development lifecycle from day one.

This cheat sheet outlines the 7 key principles and provides actionable guidance for applying them in practice.

## CISA Secure by Design Principles

### 1. Take Ownership of Customer Security Outcomes

**Guidance:**  
- Treat security as a core product responsibility.  
- Design systems to protect user data and privacy by default.  
- Ensure security decisions are deliberate, documented, and aligned with organizational policies.

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Conduct threat modeling during product inception.  
- Define Product Security Levels and enforce them throughout development.

---

### 2. Embrace Radical Transparency and Accountability

**Guidance:**  
- Make security decisions visible and auditable.  
- Encourage reporting of vulnerabilities and ensure follow-up.  

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Maintain secure logging and monitoring.  
- Integrate automated security checks into CI/CD pipelines.  
- Foster an open culture where developers can discuss security concerns without fear.

---

### 3. Lead from the Top

**Guidance:**  
- Executive and engineering leadership must prioritize security.  
- Align resources, incentives, and metrics to drive secure outcomes.

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Include security goals in performance reviews.  
- Provide training on secure development for all team members.  
- Require leadership to model security-first behaviors.

---

### 4. Build Secure by Default

**Guidance:**  
- Systems should be secure with minimal configuration.  
- Default settings should minimize exposure to vulnerabilities.  

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Disable unnecessary features, ports, and services.  
- Use secure defaults for authentication, authorization, and encryption.  
- Fail securely when errors occur.

---

### 5. Build Secure by Design

**Guidance:**  
- Security should be integrated into design decisions from the beginning, not added as an afterthought.  

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Apply security patterns, e.g., least privilege, defense-in-depth, and secure memory management.  
- Perform code reviews and security testing during development.  
- Design APIs, databases, and services with access controls and threat modeling in mind.

---

### 6. Ensure Memory Safety

**Guidance:**  
- Avoid memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free errors.  
- Use safe programming languages or practices to enforce memory safety.  

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Prefer high-level languages or safe libraries.  
- Conduct static and dynamic analysis to detect memory issues.  
- Apply automated fuzz testing for critical components.

---

### 7. Foster a Security Culture

**Guidance:**  
- Embed security awareness and responsibility throughout the organization.  
- Encourage developers to proactively think about security implications of their code.  

**Implementation Tips:**  
- Provide continuous security training.  
- Reward secure coding practices and responsible disclosure.  
- Integrate security champions into teams to guide secure development.

---

## Applying the Principles

- Use these principles as a checklist for product design, coding, and operations.  
- Document security decisions and review them regularly.  
- Combine with Secure Product Design practices for a comprehensive approach.
