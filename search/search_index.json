Taking each item on the list of \"what are we going to do about it\" and writing an abuse case may help your engineering teams process the output.</p> <p>The project OWASP Open SAMM proposes the following approach in the Stream B of the Security Practice Requirements Driven Testing for the Maturity level 2:</p> <pre><code>Misuse and abuse cases describe unintended and malicious use scenarios of the application, describing how an attacker could do this. Create misuse and abuse cases to misuse or exploit the weaknesses of controls in software features to attack an application. Use abuse-case models for an application to serve as fuel for identification of concrete security tests that directly or indirectly exploit the abuse scenarios.\n\nAbuse of functionality, sometimes referred to as a \u201cbusiness logic attack\u201d, depends on the design and implementation of application functions and features. An example is using a password reset flow to enumerate accounts. As part of business logic testing, identify the business rules that are important for the application and turn them into experiments to verify whether the application properly enforces the business rule. For example, on a stock trading application, is the attacker allowed to start a trade at the beginning of the day and lock in a price, hold the transaction open until the end of the day, then complete the sale if the stock price has risen or cancel if the price dropped?\n</code></pre> <p>Open SAMM source: Verification Requirement Driven Testing Stream B</p> <p>Another way to achieve the building of the list can be the following (more bottom-up and collaboratively oriented):</p> <p>Make a workshop that includes people with the following profiles:</p> <ul> <li>Business analyst: Will be the business key people that will describe each feature from a business point of view.</li> <li>Risk analyst: Will be the company's risk personnel that will evaluate the business risk from a proposed attack (sometimes it is the Business analyst depending on the company).</li> <li>Penetration tester: Will be the attacker that will propose attacks that they can perform on the business feature(s) in question. If the company does not have a person with this profile then it is possible to request the service of an external specialist. If possible, include 2 penetration testers with different backgrounds in order to increase the number of possible attacks that will be identified and considered.</li> <li>Technical leaders of the projects: Will be the project technical people and will allow technical exchange about attacks and countermeasures identified during the workshop.</li> <li>Quality assurance analyst or functional tester: Personnel that may have a good sense of how the application/functionality is intended to work (positive testing), not work (negative testing), and what things cause it to fail (failure cases).</li> </ul> <p>During this workshop (duration will depend on the size of the feature list, but 4 hours is a good start) all business features that will be part of the project or the sprint will be processed. The output of the workshop will be a list of attacks (abuse cases) for all business features. All abuse cases will have a risk rating that allows for filtering and prioritization.</p> <p>It is important to take into account Technical and Business kind of abuse cases and mark them accordingly.</p> <p>Example:</p> <ul> <li>Technical flagged abuse case: Add Cross Site Scripting injection into a comment input field.</li> <li>Business flagged abuse case: Ability to arbitrarily

It is targeted to be used by developers to understand and manage application security risks as they design and change an application, as well as by application security specialists doing a security risk assessment. The focus here is on protecting an application from external attack - it does not take into account attacks on the users or operators of the system (e.g. malware injection, social engineering attacks), and there is less focus on insider threats, although the principles remain the same. The internal attack surface is likely to be different from the external attack surface and some users may have a lot of access.</p> <p>Attack Surface Analysis is about mapping out what parts of a system need to be reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities. The point of Attack Surface Analysis is to understand the risk areas in an application, to make developers and security specialists aware of what parts of the application are open to attack, to find ways of minimizing this, and to notice when and how the Attack Surface changes and what this means from a risk perspective.</p> <p>While Attack Surface Analysis is usually done by security architects and pen testers, developers should understand and monitor the Attack Surface as they design and build and change a system.</p> <p>Attack Surface Analysis helps you to:</p> <ol> <li>identify what functions and what parts of the system you need to review/test for security vulnerabilities</li> <li>identify high risk areas of code that require defense-in-depth protection - what parts of the system that you need to defend</li> <li>identify when you have changed the attack surface and need to do some kind of threat assessment</li> </ol>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.html#defining-the-attack-surface-of-an-application","title":"Defining the Attack Surface of an Application","text":"<p>The Attack Surface describes all of the different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out.</p> <p>The Attack Surface of an application is:</p> <ol> <li>the sum of all paths for data/commands into and out of the application, and</li> <li>the code that protects these paths (including resource connection and authentication, authorization, activity logging, data validation and encoding)</li> <li>all valuable data used in the application, including secrets and keys, intellectual property, critical business data, personal data and PII, and</li> <li>the code that protects these data (including encryption and checksums, access auditing, and data integrity and operational security controls).</li> </ol> <p>You overlay this model with the different types of users - roles, privilege levels - that can access the system (whether authorized or not).

Then, count the number of attack points of each type. Next, choose some cases for each type. Finally, focus your review/assessment on those cases.</p> <p>With this approach, you don't need to understand every endpoint in order to understand the Attack Surface and the potential risk profile of a system.

For web apps you can use a tool like the OWASP ZAP or Arachni or Skipfish or w3af or one of the many commercial dynamic testing and vulnerability scanning tools or services to crawl your app and map the parts of the application that are accessible over the web.

Using this method you calculate an overall attack surface score for the system, and measure this score as changes are made to the system and to how it is deployed. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon built on this work to develop a formal way to calculate an Attack Surface Metric for large systems like SAP. They calculate the Attack Surface as the sum of all entry and exit points, channels (the different ways that clients or external systems connect to the system, including TCP/UDP ports, RPC end points, named pipes...) and untrusted data elements. Then they apply a damage potential/effort ratio to these Attack Surface elements to identify high-risk areas.</p> <p>Note that deploying multiple versions of an application, leaving features in that are no longer used just in case they may be needed in the future, or leaving old backup copies and unused code increases the Attack Surface. Source code control and robust change management/configurations practices should be used to ensure the actual deployed Attack Surface matches the theoretical one as closely as possible.</p> <p>Backups of code and data - online, and on offline media - are an important but often ignored part of a system's Attack Surface.

If you add another field to that page, or another web page like it, while technically you have made the Attack Surface bigger, you haven't increased the risk profile of the application in a meaningful way. Each of these incremental changes is more of the same, unless you follow a new design or use a new framework.</p> <p>If you add another web page that follows the same design and using the same technology as existing web pages, it's easy to understand how much security testing and review it needs. If you add a new web services API or file that can be uploaded from the Internet, each of these changes have a different risk profile again - see if the change fits in an existing bucket, see if the existing controls and protections apply. If you're adding something that doesn't fall into an existing bucket, this means that you have to go through a more thorough risk assessment to understand what kind of security holes you may open and what protections you need to put in place.</p> <p>Changes to session management, authentication and password management directly affect the Attack Surface and need to be reviewed. So do changes to authorization and access control logic, especially adding or changing role definitions, adding admin users or admin functions with high privileges. Similarly for changes to the code that handles encryption and secrets. Fundamental changes to how data validation is done. And major architectural changes to layering and trust relationships, or fundamental changes in technical architecture \u2013 swapping out your web server or database platform, or changing the runtime operating system.</p> <p>As you add new user types or roles or privilege levels, you do the same kind of analysis and risk assessment. Overlay the type of access across the data and functions and look for problems and inconsistencies. It's important to understand the access model for the application, whether it is positive (access is deny by default) or negative (access is allow by default). In a positive access model, any mistakes in defining what data or functions are permitted to a new user type or role are easy to see. In a negative access model, you have to be much more careful to ensure that a user does not get access to data/functions that they should not be permitted to.</p> <p>This kind of threat or risk assessment can be done periodically, or as a part of design work in serial / phased / spiral / waterfall development projects, or continuously and incrementally in Agile / iterative development.</p> <p>Normally, an application's Attack Surface will increase over time as you add more interfaces and user types and integrate with other systems. You also want to look for ways to reduce the size of the Attack Surface when you can by simplifying the model (reducing the number of user levels for example or not storing confidential data that you don't absolutely have to), turning off features and interfaces that aren't being used, by introducing operational controls such as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and real-time application-specific attack detection.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html","title":"Authentication Cheat Sheet","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Authentication (AuthN) is the process of verifying that an individual, entity, or website is who or what it claims to be by determining the validity of one or more authenticators (like passwords, fingerprints, or security tokens) that are used to back up this claim.</p> <p>Digital Identity is the unique representation of a subject engaged in an online transaction.

Authorization is distinct from authentication which is the process of verifying an entity's identity. When designing and developing a software solution, it is important to keep these distinctions in mind. A user who has been authenticated (perhaps by providing a username and password) is often not authorized to access every resource and perform every action that is technically possible through a system. For example, a web app may have both regular users and admins, with the admins being able to perform actions the average user is not privileged to do so, even though they have been authenticated. Additionally, authentication is not always required for accessing resources; an unauthenticated user may be authorized to access certain public resources, such as an image or login page, or even an entire web app.</p> <p>The objective of this cheat sheet is to assist developers in implementing authorization logic that is robust, appropriate to the app's business context, maintainable, and scalable. The guidance provided in this cheat sheet should be applicable to all phases of the development lifecycle and flexible enough to meet the needs of diverse development environments.</p> <p>Flaws related to authorization logic are a notable concern for web apps. Broken Access Control was ranked as the most concerning web security vulnerability in OWASP's 2021 Top 10 and asserted to have a \"High\" likelihood of exploit by MITRE's CWE program. Furthermore, according to Veracode's State of Software Vol. 10, Access Control was among the more common of OWASP's Top 10 risks to be involved in exploits and security incidents despite being among the least prevalent of those examined.</p> <p>The potential impact resulting from exploitation of authorization flaws is highly variable, both in form and severity. Attackers may be able read, create, modify, or delete resources that were meant to be protected (thus jeopardizing their confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability); however, the actual impact of such actions is necessarily linked to the criticality and sensitivity of the compromised resources. Thus, the business cost of a successfully exploited authorization flaw can range from very low to extremely high.</p> <p>Both entirely unauthenticated outsiders and authenticated (but not necessarily authorized) users can take advantage of authorization weaknesses.  Although honest mistakes or carelessness on the part of non-malicious entities may enable authorization bypasses, malicious intent is typically required for access control threats to be fully realized.  Horizontal privilege elevation (i.e. being able to access another user's resources) is an especially common weakness that an authenticated user may be able to take advantage of. Faults related to authorization control can allow malicious insiders and outsiders alike to view, modify, or delete sensitive resources of all forms (databases records, static files, personally identifiable information (PII), etc.) or perform actions, such as creating a new account or initiating a costly order, that they should not be privileged to do. Furthermore, if logging related to access control is not properly set-up, such authorization violations may go undetected or a least remain unattributable to a particular individual or group.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html#recommendations","title":"Recommendations","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html#enforce-least-privileges","title":"Enforce Least Privileges","text":"<p>As a security concept, Least Privileges refers to the principle of assigning users only the minimum privileges necessary to complete their job.

However, these frameworks and libraries must not be viewed as a quick panacea for all development problems; developers have a duty to use such frameworks responsibly and wisely. Two general concerns relevant to framework/library selection as relevant to proper access control are misconfiguration/lack of configuration on the part of the developer and vulnerabilities within the components themselves (see A6 and A9 for general guidance on these topics).</p> <p>Even in an otherwise securely developed application, vulnerabilities in third-party components can allow an attacker to bypass normal authorization controls. Such concerns need not be restricted to unproven or poorly maintained projects, but affect even the most robust and popular libraries and frameworks. Writing complex, secure software is hard. Even the most competent developers, working on high-quality libraries and frameworks, will make mistakes. Assume any third-party component you incorporate into an application could be or become subject to an authorization vulnerability. Important considerations include:</p> <ul> <li>Create, maintain, and follow processes for detecting and responding to vulnerable components.</li> <li>Incorporate tools such as Dependency Check into the SDLC and consider subscribing to data feeds from vendors, the NVD, or other relevant sources.</li> <li>Implement defense in depth.

These components are typically intended to be relatively general purpose tools made to appeal to a wide audience. For all but the simplest use cases, these frameworks and libraries must be customized or supplemented with additional logic in order to meet the unique requirements of a particular app or environment. This consideration is especially important when security requirements, including authorization, are concerned. Notable configuration considerations for authorization include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Take time to thoroughly understand any technology you build authorization logic upon. Analyze the technologies capabilities with an understanding that the authorization logic provided by the component may be insufficient for your application's specific security requirements. Relying on prebuilt logic may be convenient, but this does not mean it is sufficient. Understand that custom authorization logic may well be necessary to meet an app's security requirements.</li> <li>Do not let the capabilities of any library, platform, or framework guide your authorization requirements.

Documentation can be misunderstood, vague, outdated, or simply inaccurate.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html#prefer-attribute-and-relationship-based-access-control-over-rbac","title":"Prefer Attribute and Relationship Based Access Control over RBAC","text":"<p>In software engineering, two basic forms of access control are widely utilized: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). There is a third, more recent, model which has gained popularity: Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC). The decision between the models has significant implications for the entire SDLC and should be made as early as possible.</p> <ul> <li> <p>RBAC is a model of access control in which access is granted or denied based upon the roles assigned to a user. Permissions are not directly assigned to an entity; rather, permissions are associated with a role and the entity inherits the permissions of any roles assigned to it. Generally, the relationship between roles and users can be many-to-many, and roles may be hierarchical in nature.</p> </li> <li> <p>ABAC may be defined as an access control model where \"subject requests to perform operations on objects are granted or denied based on assigned attributes of the subject, assigned attributes of the object, environment conditions, and a set of policies that are specified in terms of those attributes and conditions\" (NIST SP 800-162, pg. 7]). As defined in NIST SP 800-162, attributes are simply characteristics that be represented as name-value pairs and assigned to a subject, object, or the environment. Job role, time of day, project name, MAC address, and creation date are but a very small sampling of possible attributes that highlight the flexibility of ABAC implementations.</p> </li> <li> <p>ReBAC is an access control model that grants access based on the relationships between resources. For instance, allowing only the user who created a post to edit it. This is especially necessary in social network applications, like Twitter or Facebook, where users want to limit access to their data (tweets or posts) to people they choose (friends, family, followers).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Although RBAC has a long history and remains popular among software developers today, ABAC and ReBAC should typically be preferred for application development. Their advantages over RBAC include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Support fine-grained, complex Boolean logic. In RBAC, access decisions are made on the presence or absence of roles; that is, the main characteristic of a requesting entity considered is the role(s) assigned to it. Such simplistic logic does a poor job of supporting object-level or horizontal access control decisions and those that require multiple factors.</p> <ul> <li>ABAC greatly expands both the number and type of characteristics that can be considered. In ABAC, a \"role\" or job function can certainly be one attribute assigned to a subject, but it need not be considered in isolation (or at all if this characteristic is not relevant to the particular access requested). Furthermore, ABAC can incorporate environmental and other dynamic attributes, such as time of day, type of device used, and geographic location. Denying access to a sensitive resource outside of normal business hours or if a user has not recently completely mandatory training are just a couple of examples where ABAC could meet access control requirements that RBAC would struggle to fulfill. Thus, ABAC is more effective than RBAC in addressing the principle of least privileges.</li> <li>ReBAC, since it supports assigning relationships between direct objects and direct users (and not just a role), allows for fine-grained permissions. Some systems also support algebraic operators like AND and NOT to express policies like \"if this user has relationship X but not relationship Y with the object, then grant access\".</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Robustness. In large projects or when numerous roles are present, it is easy to miss or improperly perform role checks (OWASP C7: Enforce Access Controls). This can result in both too much and too little access. This is especially true in RBAC implementations where a role hierarchy is not present and multiples role checks must be chained to have the desired impact (i.e. ( <code>if(user.hasAnyRole(\"SUPERUSER\", \"ADMIN\", \"ACCT_MANAGER\")</code> ))).</p> </li> <li>Speed. In RBAC, \"role explosion\" can occur when a system defines too many roles. If users send their credential and roles through means like HTTP headers, which have size limits, there may not be enough space to include all of the user's roles. A viable workaround to this problem is to only send the user ID, and then the application retrieves the user's roles, but this will increase the latency of every request.</li> <li>Supports Multi-Tenancy and Cross-Organizational Requests. RBAC is poorly suited for use cases where distinct organizations or customers will need access to the same set of protected resources. Meeting such requirement with RBAC would require highly cumbersome methods such as configuring rule sets for each customer in a multi-tenant environment or requiring pre-provisioning of identities for cross-organizational requests (OWASP C7; NIST SP 800-162). By contrast, as long as attributes are consistently defined, ABAC implementations allow access control decisions to be \"executed and administered in the same or separate infrastructures, while maintaining appropriate levels of security\" (NIST SP 800-162, pg. 6]).</li> <li>Ease of Management. Although the initial setup for RBAC is often simpler than ABAC, this short-term benefit quickly vanishes as the scale and complexity of a system grows. In the beginning, a couple of simple roles, such as User and Admin, may suffice for some apps, but this is very unlikely to hold true for any length of time in production applications. As roles become more numerous, both testing and auditing, critical processes for establishing trust in one's codebase and logic, become more difficult (OWASP C7). By contrast, ABAC and ReBAC are far more expressive, incorporate attributes and Boolean logic that better reflects real-world concerns, are easier to update when access-control needs change, and encourages the separation of policy management from  enforcement and provisioning of identities (NIST SP 800-162; see also XACML-V3.0 for a standard that highlights these benefits))</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html#ensure-lookup-ids-are-not-accessible-even-when-guessed-or-cannot-be-tampered-with","title":"Ensure Lookup IDs are Not Accessible Even When Guessed or Cannot Be Tampered With","text":"<p>Applications often expose the internal object identifiers (such as an account number or Primary Key in a database) that are used to locate and reference an object. This ID may exposed as a query parameter, path variable, \"hidden\" form field or elsewhere. For example:</p> <p><code>https://mybank.com/accountTransactions?acct_id=901</code></p> <p>Based on this URL, one could reasonably assume that the application will return a listing of transactions and that the transactions returned will be restricted to a particular account - the account indicated in the <code>acct_id</code> param. But what would happen if the user changed the value of the <code>acct_id</code> param to another value such as <code>523</code>. Will the user be able to view transactions associated with another account even if it does not belong to him? If not, will the failure simply be the result of the account \"523\" not existing/not being found or will it be due to a failed access control check? Although this example may be an oversimplification, it illustrates a very common security flaw in application development - CWE 639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key.  When exploited, this weakness can result in authorization bypasses, horizontal privilege escalation and, less commonly, vertical privilege escalation (see CWE-639). This type of vulnerability also represents a form of Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The following paragraphs will describe the weakness and possible mitigations.</p> <p>In the example of above, the lookup ID was not only exposed to the user and readily tampered with, but also appears to have been a fairly predictable, perhaps sequential, value.  While one can use various techniques to mask or randomize these IDs and make them hard to guess, such an approach is generally not sufficient by itself. A user should not be able to access a resource they do not have permissions simply because they are able to guess and manipulate that object's identifier in a query param or elsewhere. Rather than relying on some form of security through obscurity, the focus should be on controlling access to the underlying objects and/or the identifiers themselves. Recommended mitigations for this weakness include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Avoid exposing identifiers to the user when possible. For example it should be possible to retrieve some objects, such as account details,  based solely on currently authenticated user's identity and attributes (e.g. through information contained in a securely implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) or server-side session).</li> <li>Implement user/session specific indirect references using a tool such as OWASP ESAPI (see OWASP 2013 Top 10 - A4 Insecure Direct Object References)</li> <li>Perform access control checks on every request for the specific object or functionality being accessed.

It is an application layer agnostic validation spec which provides the developer with the means to define a set of validation constraints on a domain model and then perform validation of those constraints through out the various application tiers.</p> <p>One advantage of this approach is that the validation constraints and the corresponding validators are only written once, thus reducing duplication of effort and ensuring uniformity:</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html#typical-validation","title":"Typical Validation","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html#bean-validation","title":"Bean Validation","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html#setup","title":"Setup","text":"<p>The examples in this guide use Hibernate Validator (the reference implementation for Bean Validation 1.1).</p> <p>Add Hibernate Validator to your pom.xml:</p> <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n   &lt;groupId&gt;org.hibernate&lt;/groupId&gt;\n   &lt;artifactId&gt;hibernate-validator&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n   &lt;version&gt;5.2.4.Final&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Enable bean validation support in Spring's context.xml:</p> <pre><code>&lt;beans:beans ...\n   ...\n   &lt;mvc:annotation-driven /&gt;\n   ...\n&lt;/beans:beans&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>For more info, please see the setup guide</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html#basics","title":"Basics","text":"<p>In order to get started using Bean Validation, you must add validation constraints (<code>@Pattern</code>, <code>@Digits</code>, <code>@Min</code>, <code>@Max</code>, <code>@Size</code>, <code>@Past</code>, <code>@Future</code>, <code>@CreditCardNumber</code>, <code>@Email</code>, <code>@URL</code>, etc.) to your model and then utilize the <code>@Valid</code> annotation when passing your model around in various application layers.</p> <p>Constraints can be applied in several places:</p> <ul> <li>Fields</li> <li>Properties</li> <li>Classes</li> </ul> <p>For Bean Validation 1.1 also on:</p> <ul> <li>Parameters</li> <li>Return values</li> <li>Constructors</li> </ul> <p>For the sake of simplicity all the examples below feature field constraints and all validation is triggered by the controller.

This article will examine Microsoft and GCC toolchains for the C, C++ and Objective C languages. It will guide you through the steps you should take to create executables with firmer defensive postures and increased integration with the available platform security. Effectively configuring the toolchain also means your project will enjoy a number of benefits during development, including enhanced warnings and static analysis, and self-debugging code.</p> <p>There are four areas to be examined when hardening the toolchain: configuration, preprocessor, compiler, and linker. Nearly all areas are overlooked or neglected when setting up a project. The neglect appears to be pandemic, and it applies to nearly all projects including Auto-configured projects, makefile-based, Eclipse-based, Visual Studio-based, and Xcode-based. It's important to address the gaps at configuration and build time because it's difficult to impossible to add hardening on a distributed executable after the fact on some platforms.</p> <p>This is a prescriptive article, and it will not debate semantics or speculate on behavior. Some information, such as the C/C++ committee's motivation and pedigree for <code>program diagnostics</code>, <code>NDEBUG</code>, <code>assert</code>, and <code>abort()</code>, appears to be lost like a tale in the Lord of the Rings. As such, the article will specify semantics (for example, the philosophy of 'debug' and 'release' build configurations), assign behaviors (for example, what an assert should do in 'debug' and 'release' build configurations), and present a position. If you find the posture is too aggressive, then you should back off as required to suit your taste.</p> <p>A secure toolchain is not a silver bullet. It is one piece of an overall strategy in the engineering process to help ensure success. It will complement existing processes such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, secure coding, negative test suites, and the like. Tools such as Valgrind and Helgrind will still be needed, and a project will still require solid designs and architectures.</p> <p>The OWASP ESAPI C++ project eats its own dog food. Many of the examples you will see in this article come directly from the ESAPI C++ project.</p> <p>Finally, a Cheat Sheet is available for those who desire a terse treatment of the material.

Finally, you can use an integrated development environment or IDE.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html#build-configurations","title":"Build Configurations","text":"<p>At this stage in the process, you should concentrate on configuring for two builds: Debug and Release. Debug will be used for development and include full instrumentation. Release will be configured for production. The difference between the two settings is usually optimization level and debug level. A third build configuration is Test, and it's usually a special case of Release.</p> <p>For debug and release builds, the settings are typically diametrically opposed. Debug configurations have no optimizations and full debug information, while Release builds have optimizations and minimal to moderate debug information. In addition, debug code has full assertions and additional library integration, such as mudflaps and malloc guards such as <code>dmalloc</code>.</p> <p>The Test configuration is often a Release configuration that makes everything public for testing and builds a test harness. For example, all member functions that are public (C++ class) and all interfaces (library or shared object) should be made available for testing. Many Object Oriented purists oppose testing private interfaces, but this is not about object oriented-ness. This (q.v.) is about building reliable and secure software.</p> <p>GCC 4.8 introduced an optimization of <code>-Og</code>. Note that it is only an optimization, and still requires a customary debug level via <code>-g</code>.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html#debug-builds","title":"Debug Builds","text":"<p>Debug builds are where developers spend most of their time when vetting problems, so this build should concentrate forces and tools or be a 'force multiplier'. Though many do not realize, debug code is more highly valued than release code because it's adorned with additional instrumentation. The debug instrumentation will cause a program to become nearly \"self-debugging\", and help you catch mistakes such as bad parameters, failed API calls, and memory problems.</p> <p>Self-debugging code reduces your time during troubleshooting and debugging. Reducing time under the debugger means you have more time for development and feature requests. If code is checked in without debug instrumentation, it should be fixed by adding instrumentation or rejected.</p> <p>For GCC, optimizations and debug symbolication are controlled through two switches: <code>-O</code> and <code>-g</code>. You should use the following as part of your <code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>CXXFLAGS</code> for a minimal debug session:</p> <pre><code>-O0 -g3 -ggdb\n</code></pre> <p><code>-O0</code> turns off optimizations and <code>-g3</code> ensures maximum debug information is available. You may need to use <code>-O1</code> so some analysis is performed. Otherwise, your debug build will be missing a number of warnings not present in release builds. <code>-g3</code> ensures maximum debugging information is available for the debug session, including symbolic constants and <code>#defines</code>. <code>-ggdb</code> includes extensions to help with a debug session under GDB. For completeness, Jan Krachtovil stated <code>-ggdb</code> currently has no effect in a private email.</p> <p>Release builds should also consider the configuration pair of <code>-mfunction-return=thunk</code> and <code>-mindirect-branch=thunk</code>. These are the \"Reptoline\" fix which is an indirect branch used to thwart speculative execution CPU vulnerabilities such as Spectre and Meltdown. The CPU cannot tell what code to <code>speculatively</code> execute because it is an indirect (as opposed to a direct) branch. This is an extra layer of indirection, like calling a pointer through a pointer.</p> <p>Debug build should also define <code>DEBUG</code>, and ensure <code>NDEBUG</code> is not defined. <code>NDEBUG</code> removes \"program diagnostics\" and has undesirable behavior and side effects which are discussed below in more detail.

The tools work together to produce project files from scripts and template files. After the process completes, your project should be set up and ready to be made with <code>make</code>.</p> <p>When using auto configuration tools, there are a few files of interest worth mentioning. The files are part of the Autotools chain and include <code>m4</code> and the various <code>*.in</code>, <code>*.ac</code> (Autoconf), and <code>*.am</code> (Automake) files. At times, you will have to open them, or the resulting makefiles, to tune the \"stock\" configuration.</p> <p>There are three downsides to the command-line configuration tools in the toolchain: (1) they often ignore user requests, (2) they cannot create configurations, and (3) security is often not a goal.</p> <p>To demonstrate the first issue, configure your project with the following: <code>configure</code> <code>CFLAGS=\"-Wall</code> <code>-fPIE\"</code> <code>CXXFLAGS=\"-Wall</code> <code>-fPIE\"</code> <code>LDFLAGS=\"-pie\"</code>. You will probably find that Autotools ignored your request, which means the command below will not produce expected results. As a workaround, you will have to open an <code>m4</code> script, <code>makefile.in</code> or <code>makefile.am</code>, and fix the configuration.</p> <pre><code>$ configure CFLAGS=\"-Wall -Wextra -Wconversion -fPIE -Wno-unused-parameter\n    -Wformat=2 -Wformat-security -fstack-protector-all -Wstrict-overflow\"\n    LDFLAGS=\"-pie -z,noexecstack -z,noexecheap -z,relro -z,now\"\n</code></pre> <p>For the second point, you will probably be disappointed to learn Automake does not support the concept of configurations. It's not entirely Autoconf's or Automake's fault - Make and its inability to detect changes is the underlying problem. Specifically, Make only checks modification times of prerequisites and targets, and does not check things like <code>CFLAGS</code> and <code>CXXFLAGS</code>. The net effect is you will not receive expected results when you issue <code>make</code> <code>debug</code> and then <code>make</code> <code>test</code> or <code>make</code> <code>release</code>.</p> <p>Finally, you will probably be disappointed to learn tools such as Autoconf and Automake miss many security related opportunities and ship insecure out of the box. There are a number of compiler switches and linker flags that improve the defensive posture of a program, but they are not 'on' by default. Tools like Autoconf - which are supposed to handle this situation - often provide settings to serve the lowest of all denominators.</p> <p>A recent discussion on the Automake mailing list illuminates the issue: Enabling compiler warning flags. Attempts to improve default configurations were met with resistance and no action was taken. The resistance is often of the form, \"<code>&lt;some useful warning&gt; also produces false positives</code>\" or \"<code>&lt;some obscure platform&gt; does not support &lt;established security feature&gt;</code>\".

Unfortunately, Make has a number of shortcomings (Recursive Make Considered Harmful and What's Wrong With GNU make?), and can cause some discomfort. Despite issues with Make, ESAPI C++ uses Make primarily for three reasons: first, it's omnipresent; second, it's easier to manage than the Autotools family; and third, <code>libtool</code> was out of the question.</p> <p>Consider what happens when you: (1) type <code>make</code> <code>debug</code>, and then type <code>make</code> <code>release</code>.

ESAPI C++ does its best to ensure a user's flags are honored via <code>override</code> as shown above, but other projects do not. For example, consider a project that should be built with Position Independent Executable (PIE or ASLR) enabled and data execution prevention (DEP) enabled. Dismissing user settings combined with insecure out of the box settings (and not picking them up during auto-setup or auto-configure) means a program built with the following will likely have neither defense:</p> <pre><code>make CFLAGS=\"-fPIE\" CXXFLAGS=\"-fPIE\" LDFLAGS=\"-pie -z,noexecstack, -z,noexecheap\"\n</code></pre> <p>Defenses such as ASLR and DEP are especially important on Linux because Data Execution - not Prevention - is the norm.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html#integration","title":"Integration","text":"<p>Project level integration presents opportunities to harden your program or library with domain specific knowledge. For example, if the platform supports Position Independent Executables (PIE or ASLR) and data execution prevention (DEP), then you should integrate with it. The consequences of not doing so could result in exploitation. As a case in point, see KingCope's 0-days for MySQL in December, 2012 (CVE-2012-5579 and CVE-2012-5612, among others). Integration with platform security would have neutered a number of the 0-days.</p> <p>You also have the opportunity to include helpful libraries that are not needed for business logic support. For example, if you are working on a platform with DMalloc or Address Sanitizer, you should probably use it in your debug builds. For Ubuntu, DMalloc is available from the package manager and can be installed with <code>sudo apt install libdmalloc5</code>. For Apple platforms, it's available as a scheme option. Address Sanitizer is available in GCC 4.8 and above for many platforms.</p> <p>In addition, project level integration is an opportunity to harden third party libraries you chose to include. Because you chose to include them, you and your users are responsible for them. If you or your users endure a <code>SP800-53</code> audit, third party libraries will be in scope because the supply chain is included (specifically, item SA-12, Supply Chain Protection). The audits are not limited to those in the US Federal arena - financial institutions perform reviews, too. A perfect example of violating this guidance is CVE-2012-1525, which was due to Adobe's inclusion of a defective Sablotron library.</p> <p>Another example is including OpenSSL. You know (1) SSLv2 is insecure, (2) SSLv3 is insecure, and (3) compression is insecure (among others). In addition, suppose you don't use hardware and engines, and only allow static linking.

To have OpenSSL use the processor's random number generator (via the <code>rdrand</code> instruction), you will need to call OpenSSL's <code>ENGINE_load_rdrand()</code> function and then <code>ENGINE_set_default</code> with <code>ENGINE_METHOD_RAND</code>. See OpenSSL's Random Numbers for details.</p> <p>If you configure without the switches, then you will likely have vulnerable code/libraries and risk failing an audit.

In fact, any symbol within the <code>OPENSSL_NO_COMP</code> preprocessor macro will bear witness since <code>-no-comp</code> is translated into a <code>CFLAGS</code> define.</p> <pre><code>$ nm /usr/local/ssl/iphoneos/lib/libcrypto.a 2&gt;/dev/null | egrep -i \"(COMP_CTX_new|COMP_CTX_free)\"\n0000000000000110 T COMP_CTX_free\n0000000000000000 T COMP_CTX_new\n</code></pre> <p>Even more egregious is the answer given to auditors who specifically ask about configurations and protocols: \"we don't use weak/wounded/broken ciphers\" or \"we follow best practices.\" The use of compression tells the auditor that you are using wounded protocols in an insecure configuration and you don't follow best practices.

Asserts should be used throughout your program, including parameter validation, return value checking and program state. The <code>assert</code> will silently guard your code through its lifetime. It will always be there, even when not debugging a specific component of a module. If you have thorough code coverage, you will spend less time debugging and more time developing because programs will debug themselves.</p> <p>To use asserts effectively, you should assert everything. That includes parameters upon entering a function, return values from function calls, and any program state.

Remember, this is all about finding the point of first failure quickly so you can spend your time doing other things.</p> <p>There is one problem with using asserts - Posix states <code>assert</code> should call <code>abort()</code> if <code>NDEBUG</code> is not defined. When debugging, <code>NDEBUG</code> will never be defined since you want the \"program diagnostics\" (quote from the Posix description). The behavior makes <code>assert</code> and its accompanying <code>abort()</code> completely useless for development. The result of \"program diagnostics\" calling <code>abort()</code> due to standard C/C++ behavior is disuse - developers simply don't use them. It's incredibly bad for the development community because self-debugging programs can help eradicate so many stability problems.</p> <p>Since self-debugging programs are so powerful, you will have to supply your own assert and signal handler with improved behavior.

The potential mistakes are detected via a compiler which carries around a lot of contextual information during its code analysis phase. At times, you will receive spurious warnings because the compiler is not that smart. It's understandable and even a good thing (how would you like to be out of a job because a program writes its own programs?). At times you will have to learn how to work with the compiler's warning system to suppress warnings. Notice what was not said: turn off the warnings.</p> <p>Suppressing warnings placates the compiler for spurious noise so you can get to the issues that matter (you are separating the wheat from the chaff). This section will offer some hints and point out some potential minefields. First is an unused parameter (for example, <code>argc</code> or <code>argv</code>). Suppressing unused parameter warnings is especially helpful for C++ and interface programming, where parameters are often unused. For this warning, simply define an \"UNUSED\" macro and warp the parameter:</p> <pre><code>##define UNUSED_PARAMETER(x) ((void)x)\n\u2026\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\n{\n    UNUSED_PARAMETER(argc);\n    UNUSED_PARAMETER(argv);\n    \u2026\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A potential minefield lies near \"comparing unsigned and signed\" values, and <code>-Wconversion</code> will catch it for you. This is because C/C++ promotion rules state the signed value will be promoted to an unsigned value and then compared. That means <code>-1</code> <code>&gt;</code> <code>1</code> after promotion! To fix this, you cannot blindly cast - you must first range test the value:</p> <pre><code>int x = GetX();\nunsigned int y = GetY();\n\nASSERT(x &gt;= 0);\nif(!(x &gt;= 0))\n    throw runtime_error(\"WTF??? X is negative.\");\n\nif(static_cast&lt;unsigned int&gt;(x) &gt; y)\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"x is greater than y\" &lt;&lt; endl;\nelse\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"x is not greater than y\" &lt;&lt; endl;\n</code></pre> <p>Notice the code above will debug itself - you don't need to set a breakpoint to see if there is a problem with <code>x</code>. Just run the program and wait for it to tell you there is a problem. If there is a problem, the program will snap the debugger (and more importantly, not call a useless <code>abort()</code> as specified by Posix). It beats the snot out of <code>printf</code>s that are removed when no longer needed or that pollute outputs.</p> <p>Another conversion problem you will encounter is conversion between types, and <code>-Wconversion</code> will also catch it for you. The following will always have an opportunity to fail, and should light up like a Christmas tree:</p> <pre><code>struct sockaddr_in addr;\n\u2026\n\naddr.sin_port = htons(atoi(argv[2]));\n</code></pre> <p>The following would probably serve you much better. Notice <code>atoi</code> and friends are not used because they can silently fail. In addition, the code is instrumented so you don't need to waste a lot of time debugging potential problems:</p> <pre><code>const char* cstr = GetPortString();\n\nASSERT(cstr != NULL);\nif(!(cstr != NULL))\n    throw runtime_error(\"WTF??? Port string is not valid.\");\n\nistringstream iss(cstr);\nlong long t = 0;\niss &gt;&gt; t;\n\nASSERT(!(iss.fail()));\nif(iss.fail())\n    throw runtime_error(\"WTF??? Failed to read port.\");\n\n// Should this be a port above the reserved range ([0-1024] on Unix)?\nASSERT(t &gt; 0);\nif(!(t &gt; 0))\n    throw runtime_error(\"WTF??? Port is too small\");\n\nASSERT(t &lt; static_cast&lt;long long&gt;(numeric_limits&lt;unsigned int&gt;::max()));\nif(!(t &lt; static_cast&lt;long long&gt;(numeric_limits&lt;unsigned int&gt;::max())))\n    throw runtime_error(\"WTF??? Port is too large\");\n\n// OK to use port\nunsigned short port = static_cast&lt;unsigned short&gt;(t);\n\u2026\n</code></pre> <p>Again, notice the code above will debug itself - you don't need to set a breakpoint to see if there is a problem with <code>port</code>. This code will continue checking conditions, years after being instrumented (assuming to write code to read a config file early in the project). There's no need to remove the <code>ASSERT</code>s as with <code>printf</code> since they are silent guardians.</p> <p>Another useful suppression trick is to avoid ignoring return values. Not only is it useful to suppress the warning, it's required for correct code. For example, <code>snprint</code> will alert you to truncations through its return value. You should not make them silent truncations by ignoring the warning or casting to <code>void</code>:</p> <pre><code>char path[PATH_MAX];\n\u2026\n\nint ret = snprintf(path, sizeof(path), \"%s/%s\", GetDirectory(), GetObjectName());\nASSERT(ret != -1);\nASSERT(!(ret &gt;= sizeof(path)));\n\nif(ret == -1 || ret &gt;= sizeof(path))\n    throw runtime_error(\"WTF??? Unable to build full object name\");\n\n// OK to use path\n\u2026\n</code></pre> <p>The problem is pandemic, and not just boring user-land programs. Projects which offer high integrity code, such as SELinux, suffer silent truncations. The following is from an approved SELinux patch even though a comment was made that it suffered silent truncations in its <code>security_compute_create_name</code> function from <code>compute_create.c</code>.</p> <pre><code>12  int security_compute_create_raw(security_context_t scon,\n13                                  security_context_t tcon,\n14                                  security_class_t   tclass,\n15                                  security_context_t * newcon)\n16  {\n17    char path[PATH_MAX];\n18    char *buf;\n19    size_t size;\n20    int fd, ret;\n21\n22    if (!selinux_mnt) {\n23      errno = ENOENT;\n24      return -1;\n25    }\n26\n27    snprintf(path, sizeof path, \"%s/create\", selinux_mnt);\n28    fd = open(path, O_RDWR);\n</code></pre> <p>Unlike other examples, the above code will not debug itself, and you will have to set breakpoints and trace calls to determine the point of first failure. (And the code above gambles that the truncated file does not exist or is not under an adversary's control by blindly performing the <code>open</code>).</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/C-Based_Toolchain_Hardening_Cheat_Sheet.html#runtime","title":"Runtime","text":"<p>The previous sections concentrated on setting up your project for success.

Following some simple guidelines can help substantially mitigate, though certainly not eliminate, risk.</p> <p>First, one should take steps to reduce the likelihood that secrets can be stolen in a usable format. Secrets should never be hardcoded in code repositories or CI/CD configuration files. Employ tools such as git-leaks or git-secrets to detect such secrets. Strive to prevent secrets from ever being committed in the first place and perform ongoing monitoring to detect any deviations. Secrets must also be removed from other artifacts such as Docker images and compiled binaries. Secrets must always be encrypted using industry accepted standards. Encryption must be applied while secrets are at-rest in a file-system, vault, or similar store; however, one must also ensure these secrets are not disclosed or persisted in cleartext as a consequence of use in the CI/CD pipeline. For example, secrets must not be printed out to the console, logged, or stored in a system's command history files (such as <code>~/.bash-history</code>).

One should adopt a \"deny by default\" mindset. Any identities used within the pipeline must be assigned only the minimum permissions necessary to do its job. For example, if a pipeline must access an AWS service in order to complete its task, the AWS credentials used in that pipeline must only be able to perform the specific operations on the  specific services and resources it requires to perform its task. Similarly, credential sharing across pipelines should be kept to a minimum; in particular, such sharing should not occur across pipelines having different levels of sensitivity or value. If pipeline A does not require access to the same secrets pipeline B requires, they should ideally not be shared.

Once provisioned, identities must be tracked, maintained, and, when necessary, deprovisioned. Of particular concern in complex, distributed CI/CD environments is ensuring that an accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date inventory of identities is maintained. The format of this inventory can vary by organizational needs, but, in addition to the identity itself, suggested fields include identity owner or responsible party, identity provider, last used, last updated, granted permissions, and permissions actually used by the identity. Such an inventory will help one readily identify identities which may be over-privileged or which may be candidates for deprovisioning.

This issue is especially pressing in the context of CI/CD as such environments interact with third-party code in multiple ways. Two such areas of interaction, the dependencies used by projects running within the pipeline and the third-party integrations and plug-ins with the CI/CD system itself will be discussed below.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/CI_CD_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#dependency-management","title":"Dependency Management","text":"<p>Using third-party packages with known vulnerabilities is a well-known problem in software engineering, and many tools have been developed to address this. In the context of CI/CD, automated use of SCA and comparable tools can actually assist in improving security in this area. However, the CI/CD environment itself is susceptible to a different, but related, risk: dependency chain abuse.</p> <p>Dependency chain abuse involves the exploitation of flaws within a system's dependency chain and dependency resolution processes; a successful attack can result in the execution of malicious code from an attacker controlled package. The dependency chain itself refers to the set of packages, including internal, direct third-party, and transitive dependencies, that a software solution requires to function. An attacker can take advantage of this dependency chain through methods such as dependency confusion, typosquatting, or takeover of a valid package maintainer's account. Dependency chain abuse attacks can be quite complex and comprehensive defense is correspondingly so; however, basic mitigation are quite straightforward.</p> <p>Mitigation techniques begin early on in the SDLC, well before the CI/CD pipeline begins execution. The project's package management technology (such as npm) should be configured in such a way as to ensure dependency references are immutable (CISA et al. 2022). Version pinning should be performed, the version chosen for pinning must be one that is known to be valid and secure, and the integrity of any package the system downloads should be validated by comparing its hash or checksum to a  known good hash of the pinned package. The exact procedures to achieve this will vary depending on the project's underlying technology, but, in general, both version pinning and hash verification can be performed via a platform's \"lock\" or similar file (i.e. package-lock.json or  Pipfile.lock). Prefer using private repositories where possible, and configure the package manager to use only a single private feed (Microsoft, 2021). For private packages, leverage scoped NPM packages,  ID prefixes for NuGet packages, or a comparable feature to reduce the risk of dependency confusion. Finally, regardless of the platform used, ensure the file(s) responsible for controlling these settings (such as <code>.npmrc</code> in node environments), is committed to source control and accessible in the CI/CD environment.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/CI_CD_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#plug-in-and-integration-management","title":"Plug-In and Integration Management","text":"<p>Most CI/CD platforms are extensible through means of plug-ins or other third-party integrations.

This is not to say that plug-ins should necessarily be disallowed; rather, the risk must simply be considered and reduced to an acceptable level.</p> <p>Installation of plug-ins or integration with third-party services should be treated like the acquisition of any software. These tools are often easy to install and setup, but this does not mean their installation and usage should go ungoverned. Least privileges must be enforced to ensure only a small subset of users even have the permissions required to extend CI/CD platforms. Additionally, such extensions must be vetted before installation. Questions to consider are comparable to those that should be asked before any software acquisition:</p> <ul> <li>Is the vendor a recognized and respected developer or company?</li> <li>Does the vendor have a strong or weak history in regards to application security?</li> <li>How popular is the specific plug-in or integration endpoint?</li> <li>Is the plugin or integration actively maintained?</li> <li>Will the extension require configuration changes that could reduce security (such as exposing additional ports)?</li> <li>Does the organization have the experience and resources to properly configure and maintain the offering?</li> </ul> <p>After a plug-in or other integration has been approved, it must be incorporated into the organization's configuration management processes.

As such, integrity verification is an important method of reducing risk in CI/CD environments.</p> <p>As with many other defensive actions, implementation of integrity related controls begins early in the SDLC. As noted earlier, the SCM should require commits to be signed before the code can be merged. Also, as discussed in Dependency Management, the package management platform should be configured to use hashes or comparable to verify the integrity of a package. Code signing should also be employed; technologies such as Sigstore or Signserver may be used for this purpose. However, it is important to note that code signing and related technologies are not absolute guarantors of security; the code signing processes itself can be exploited. Please see NIST's Security Considerations for Code Signing for additional guidance on securing the code signing processes.

However, visibility into these systems is critical for detecting potential attacks, better understand one's risk posture, and detecting and remediating vulnerabilities. Though their value is often underestimated, logging and log analysis are vital for providing visibility into CI/CD systems.</p> <p>The first step in increasing CI/CD visibility, is ensuring that the logging configuration within the CI/CD environment is compliant with your organization's log management policy. Beyond adherence to internal policies, configure the system to log data in a readily parsable format such as JSON or syslog. Carefully consider what content needs to be logged and at what verbosity. Although proper logging should allow for end-to-end visibility of the pipeline, more logging is not inherently better. One must not only consider the storage costs associated with logs, but also take care to avoid logging any sensitive data. For example, most authentication related events likely should be logged. However, one should never log plaintext passwords, authentication tokens, API keys, or similar secrets.</p> <p>Once an appropriate logging strategy has been defined and necessary configuration has been performed, one is ready to start utilizing these logs to reduce risk. Sending aggregate logs to a centralized log management system or, preferably, a SIEM is a first step for realizing the value of logs. If a SIEM is used, alert should be carefully configured, and regularly refined, in order to provide timely alerts of anomalies and potential attacks. The exact configuration will vary significantly depending on the CI/CD environment, SIEM platform, and other factors. For an overview of CI/CD observability within the context of the ELK Stack (a popular SIEM platform) refer to this article or reference this article for an alternative approach which can be readily adapted to a variety of CI/CD environments. It is important to keep in mind that SIEM alerts will never be 100% accurate in detecting CI/CD attacks. Both false positive and false negatives will occur. Such platforms should not be relied on unquestioningly, but they do provide important visibility into CI/CD environments and can act as important alert systems when thoughtfully configured.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/CI_CD_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#references","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/CI_CD_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#general-references","title":"General References","text":"<ul> <li>CISA, NSA, &amp; ODNI (2022).

Short (i.e. burst) and long time periods should be considered, as well as high request volume and instances where one IP address, likely in concert with many other IP addresses, generates low but consistent volumes of traffic.  Additionally, mitigation decisions should consider factors such as IP address classification (ex: residential vs hosting) and geolocation.  These factors may be leveraged to raise or lower mitigation thresholds in order to reduce potential impact on legitimate users or more aggresively mitigate abuse originating from abnormal sources.  Mitigations, especially blocking an IP address, should be temporary and processes should be in place to remove an IP address from a mitigated state as abuse declines or stops.</p> <p>Many credential stuffing toolkits, such as Sentry MBA, offer built-in use of proxy networks to distribute requests across a large volume of unique IP addressess.

You are not always able to simply grab the target origin (i.e., its hostname and port <code>#</code>) from the URL in the request, because the application server is frequently sitting behind one or more proxies. This means that the original URL can be different from the URL the app server actually receives. However, if your application server is directly accessed by its users, then using the origin in the URL is fine and you're all set.</p> <p>If you are behind a proxy, there are a number of options to consider.</p> <ul> <li>Configure your application to simply know its target origin: Since it is your application, you can find its target origin and set that value in some server configuration entry. This would be the most secure approach as its defined server side, so it is a trusted value. However, this might be problematic to maintain if your application is deployed in many places, e.g., dev, test, QA, production, and possibly multiple production instances. Setting the correct value for each of these situations might be difficult, but if you can do it via some central configuration and provide your instances the ability to grab the value from it, that's great! (Note: Make sure the centralized configuration store is maintained securely because major part of your CSRF defense depends on it.)</li> <li>Use the Host header value: If you want your application to find its own target so it doesn't have to be configured for each deployed instance, we recommend using the Host family of headers. The Host header is meant to contain the target origin of the request. But, if your app server is sitting behind a proxy, the Host header value is most likely changed by the proxy to the target origin of the URL behind the proxy, which is different than the original URL. This modified Host header origin won't match the source origin in the original Origin or Referer headers.</li> <li>Use the X-Forwarded-Host header value: To avoid the possibility that the proxy will alter the host header, you can use another header called X-Forwarded-Host to contain the original Host header value the proxy received. Most proxies will pass along the original Host header value in the X-Forwarded-Host header. So the value in X-Forwarded-Host is likely to be the target origin value that you need to compare to the source origin in the Origin or Referer header.</li> </ul> <p>Using this header value for mitigation will work properly when origin or referrer headers are present in the requests. Though these headers are included the majority of the time, there are few use cases where they are not included (most of them are for legitimate reasons to safeguard users privacy/to tune to browsers ecosystem).</p> <p>Use cases where X-Forward-Host is not employed:</p> <ul> <li>In an instance following a 302 redirect cross-origin, Origin is not included in the redirected request because that may be considered sensitive information that should not be sent to the other origin.</li> <li>There are some privacy contexts where Origin is set to \"null\" For example, see the following here.</li> <li>Origin header is included for all cross origin requests but for same origin requests, in most browsers it is only included in POST/DELETE/PUT Note: Although it is not ideal, many developers use GET requests to do state changing operations.</li> <li>Referer header is no exception. There are multiple use cases where referrer header is omitted as well (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). Load balancers, proxies and embedded network devices are also well known to strip the referrer header due to privacy reasons in logging them.</li> </ul> <p>Usually, a minor percentage of traffic does fall under above categories (1-2%) and no enterprise would want to lose this traffic. One of the popular technique used across the Internet to make this technique more usable is to accept the request if the Origin/referrer matches your configured list of domains \"OR\" a null value (Examples here.

While this can be successful for very specific applications (for instance, if you validate that all the input requests that are ever rendered are only alphanumeric data), it violates the major tenet of XSS defense where perform output encoding as close to where the data is rendered is possible. Generally, the HTTP request is examined for query and POST parameters but other things HTTP request headers that might be rendered such as cookie data, are not examined. The common approach that we've seen is someone will call either <code>ESAPI.validator().getValidSafeHTML()</code> or <code>ESAPI.encoder.canonicalize()</code> and depending on the results will redirect to an error page or call something like <code>ESAPI.encoder().encodeForHTML()</code>. Aside from the fact that this approach often misses tainted input such as request headers or \"extra path information\" in a URI, the approach completely ignores the fact that the output encoding is completely non-contextual. For example, how does a servlet filter know that an input query parameter is going to be rendered in an HTML context (i.e., between HTML tags) rather than in a JavaScript context such as within a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag or used with a JavaScript event handler attribute? It doesn't. And because JavaScript and HTML encoding are not interchangeable, you leave yourself still open to XSS attacks.</p> <p>Unless your filter or interceptor has full knowledge of your application and specifically an awareness of how your application uses each parameter for a given request, it can't succeed for all the possible edge cases. And we would contend that it never will be able to using this approach because providing that additional required context is way too complex of a design and accidentally introducing some other vulnerability (possibly one whose impact is far worse than XSS) is almost inevitable if you attempt it.</p> <p>This naive approach usually has at least one of these four problems.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#problem-1-encoding-for-specific-context-not-satisfactory-for-all-uri-paths","title":"Problem 1 - Encoding for specific context not satisfactory for all URI paths","text":"<p>One problem is the improper encoding that can still allow exploitable XSS in some URI paths of your application.

The problem is that unless your application is strictly validating that data at the point that it is retrieved (which generally is the only point your application has enough context to do a strict data validation using an allow-list approach), that data should always be considered tainted. But if you are attempting to do output encoding or strict data validation all of tainted data on the HTTP response side of an interceptor (such as a Java servlet filter), at that point, your application's interceptor will have no idea of there is tainted data present from those REST web services or other databases that you used. The approach that generally is used on response-side interceptors attempting to provide XSS defense has been to only consider the matching \"input parameters\" as tainted and do output encoding or HTML sanitization on them and everything else is considered safe. But sometimes it's not? While it frequently is assumed that all internal web services and all internal databases can be \"trusted\" and used as it, this is a very bad assumption to make unless you have included that in some deep threat modeling for your application.</p> <p>For example, suppose you are working on an application to show a customer their detailed monthly bill. Let's assume that your application is either querying a foreign (as in not part of your specific application) internal database or REST web service that your application uses to obtain the user's full name, address, etc. But that data originates from another application which you are assuming is \"trusted\" but actually has an unreported persistent XSS vulnerability on the various customer address-related fields. Furthermore, let's assume that you company's customer support staff can examine a customer's detailed bill to assist them when customers have questions about their bills. So nefarious customer decides to plant an XSS bomb in the address field and then calls customer service for assistance with the bill. Should a scenario like that ever play out, an interceptor attempting to prevent XSS is going to miss that completely and the result is going to be something much worse than just popping an alert box to display \"1\" or \"XSS\" or \"pwn'd\".</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>One final note: If deploying interceptors / filters as an XSS defense was a useful approach against XSS attacks, don't you think that it would be incorporated into all commercial Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and be an approach that OWASP recommends in this cheat sheet?</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#related-articles","title":"Related Articles","text":"<p>XSS Attack Cheat Sheet:</p> <p>The following article describes how attackers can exploit different kinds of XSS vulnerabilities (and this article was created to help you avoid them):</p> <ul> <li>OWASP: XSS Filter Evasion Cheat Sheet.</li> </ul> <p>Description of XSS Vulnerabilities:</p> <ul> <li>OWASP article on XSS Vulnerabilities.</li> </ul> <p>Discussion about the Types of XSS Vulnerabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Types of Cross-Site Scripting.</li> </ul> <p>How to Review Code for Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities:</p> <ul> <li>OWASP Code Review Guide article on Reviewing Code for Cross-site scripting Vulnerabilities.</li> </ul> <p>How to Test for Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities:</p> <ul> <li>OWASP Testing Guide article on testing for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.</li> <li>XSS Experimental Minimal Encoding Rules#  &lt;#Title#&gt;</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html","title":"Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This article provides a simple model to follow when implementing solutions to protect data at rest.</p> <p>Passwords should not be stored using reversible encryption - secure password hashing algorithms should be used instead.

This cheatsheet addresses DOM (Document Object Model) based XSS and is an extension (and assumes comprehension) of the XSS Prevention Cheatsheet.</p> <p>In order to understand DOM based XSS, one needs to see the fundamental difference between Reflected and Stored XSS when compared to DOM based XSS. The primary difference is where the attack is injected into the application.</p> <p>Reflected and Stored XSS are server side injection issues while DOM based XSS is a client (browser) side injection issue.</p> <p>All of this code originates on the server, which means it is the application owner's responsibility to make it safe from XSS, regardless of the type of XSS flaw it is. Also, XSS attacks always execute in the browser.</p> <p>The difference between Reflected/Stored XSS is where the attack is added or injected into the application. With Reflected/Stored the attack is injected into the application during server-side processing of requests where untrusted input is dynamically added to HTML. For DOM XSS, the attack is injected into the application during runtime in the client directly.</p> <p>When a browser is rendering HTML and any other associated content like CSS or JavaScript, it identifies various rendering contexts for the different kinds of input and follows different rules for each context. A rendering context is associated with the parsing of HTML tags and their attributes.</p> <ul> <li>The HTML parser of the rendering context dictates how data is presented and laid out on the page and can be further broken down into the standard contexts of HTML, HTML attribute, URL, and CSS.</li> <li>The JavaScript or VBScript parser of an execution context is associated with the parsing and execution of script code. Each parser has distinct and separate semantics in the way they can possibly execute script code which make creating consistent rules for mitigating vulnerabilities in various contexts difficult. The complication is compounded by the differing meanings and treatment of encoded values within each subcontext (HTML, HTML attribute, URL, and CSS) within the execution context.</li> </ul> <p>For the purposes of this article, we refer to the HTML, HTML attribute, URL, and CSS contexts as subcontexts because each of these contexts can be reached and set within a JavaScript execution context.</p> <p>In JavaScript code, the main context is JavaScript but with the right tags and context closing characters, an attacker can try to attack the other 4 contexts using equivalent JavaScript DOM methods.</p> <p>The following is an example vulnerability which occurs in the JavaScript context and HTML subcontext:</p> <pre><code> &lt;script&gt;\n var x = '&lt;%= taintedVar %&gt;';\n var d = document.createElement('div');\n d.innerHTML = x;\n document.body.appendChild(d);\n &lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Let's look at the individual subcontexts of the execution context in turn.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#rule-1-html-escape-then-javascript-escape-before-inserting-untrusted-data-into-html-subcontext-within-the-execution-context","title":"RULE #1 - HTML Escape then JavaScript Escape Before Inserting Untrusted Data into HTML Subcontext within the Execution Context","text":"<p>There are several methods and attributes which can be used to directly render HTML content within JavaScript.

It is a fundamental layer underlying the logical data structures of the higher-level functions in a network. Typical DoS scenarios that involve the physical layer involve system destruction, obstruction, and malfunction. For example, a Georgian elderly woman sliced through an underground cable, resulting in the loss of internet for the whole of Armenia.</p> <p>The data layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between adjacent network nodes in a wide area network (WAN) or between nodes on the same local area network (LAN) segment. Typical DoS scenarios are MAC flooding (targeting switch MAC tables) and ARP poisoning.</p> <p>In MAC flooding attacks, a switch is flooded with packets that all have different source MAC addresses. The goal of this attack is to consume the limited memory used by a switch to store the MAC and physical port translation table (MAC table), which causes valid MAC addresses to be purged and forces the switch to enter a fail-over mode where it becomes a network hub. If this occurs, all data is forwarded to all ports, resulting in a data leakage.</p> <p>[Future additions to sheet: The impact in relation to DoS and document compact remediation]</p> <p>In ARP poisoning attacks, a malicious actor sends spoofed ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over the wire. If the attacker's MAC address becomes linked to the IP address of a legitimate device on the network, the attacker can intercept, modify or stop data that was intended for the victim IP address. The ARP protocol is specific to the local area network and could cause a DoS on the wire communication.</p> <p>Packet filtering technology can be used to inspect packets in transit to identify and block offending ARP packets. Another approach is to use static ARP tables but they prove difficult to be maintained.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Denial_of_Service_Cheat_Sheet.html#application-attacks","title":"Application attacks","text":"<p>Application layer attacks usually make applications unavailable by exhausting system resources or by making it unusable in a functional way.

You need to continue some level of functionality when portions of a system or application break. One of the main problems with DoS is that it causes sudden and abrupt application terminations throughout the system. A fault tolerant design enables a system or application to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely if parts of the system fails.</li> <li>Prevent single point of failure: Detecting and preventing single points of failure (SPOF) is key to resisting DoS attacks. Most DoS attacks assume that a system has SPOFs that will fail due to overwhelmed systems. We suggest that you employ stateless components, use redundant systems, create bulkheads to stop failures from spreading across the infrastructure, and make sure that systems can survive when external services fail. Prevention</li> <li>Avoid highly CPU consuming operations: When a DoS attack occurs, operations that tend to use a lot of CPU resources can become serious drags on system performance and can become a point of failure.

See this page or consult your GraphQL implementation's documentation to learn how to disable introspection altogether. If your implementation does not natively support disabling introspection or if you would like to allow some consumers/roles to have this access, you can build a filter in your service to only allow approved consumers to access the introspection system.</p> <p>Keep in mind that even if introspection is disabled, attackers can still guess fields by brute forcing them. Furthermore, GraphQL has a built-in feature to return a hint when a field name that the requester provides is similar (but incorrect) to an existing field (e.g. request has <code>usr</code> and the response will ask <code>Did you mean \"user?\"</code>). You should consider disabling this feature if you have disabled the introspection, to decrease the exposure, but not all implementations of GraphQL support doing so. Shapeshifter is one tool that should be able to do this.</p> <p>Disable Introspection - Java</p> <pre><code>GraphQLSchema schema = GraphQLSchema.newSchema()\n    .query(StarWarsSchema.queryType)\n    .fieldVisibility( NoIntrospectionGraphqlFieldVisibility.NO_INTROSPECTION_FIELD_VISIBILITY )\n    .build();\n</code></pre> <p>Disable Introspection &amp; GraphiQL - JavaScript</p> <pre><code>app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({\n  schema: MySessionAwareGraphQLSchema,\n+ validationRules: [NoIntrospection]\n  graphiql: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',\n}));\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/GraphQL_Cheat_Sheet.html#dont-return-excessive-errors","title":"Don't Return Excessive Errors","text":"<p>GraphQL APIs in production shouldn't return stack traces or be in debug mode.

Plugins such as TFLint, Checkov, Docker Linter, docker-vulnerability-extension, Security Scan, Contrast Security, etc., help in the security assessment of the IaC.</li> <li>Threat modelling - Build the threat modelling landscape earlier in the development cycle to ensure there is enough visibility of the high-risk, high-volume aspects of the code and flexibility to include security throughout to ensure the assets are safely managed.</li> <li>Managing secrets -  Secrets are confidential data and information such as application tokens required for authentication, passwords, and SSH (Secure Shell) keys. The problem is not the secrets, but where you store them. If you are using a simple text file or SCMs like Git, then the secrets can be easily exposed. Open-source tools such as truffleHog, git-secrets, GitGuardian and similar can be utilized to detect such vulnerable management of secrets. See the Secrets Management Cheat Sheet for more information.</li> <li>Version control - Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Ensure all the changes to the IaC are tracked with the right set of information that helps in any revert operation. The important part is that you\u2019re checking in those changes alongside the features they support and not separately. A feature\u2019s infrastructure requirements should be a part of a feature\u2019s branch or merge request. Git is generally used as the source code version control system.</li> <li> <p>Principle of least privilege - define the access management policies based on the principle of least privilege with the following priority items:</p> <ul> <li>Defining who is and is not authorized to create/update/run/delete the scripts and inventory.</li> <li>Limiting the permissions of authorized IaC users to what is necessary to perform their tasks. The IaC scripts should ensure that the permissions granted to the various resources it creates are limited to what is required for them to perform their work.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Static analysis - Analyzes code in isolation, identifying risks, misconfigurations, and compliance faults only relevant to the IaC itself. Tools such as kubescan, Snyk, Coverity etc, can be leveraged for static analysis of IaC.</p> </li> <li>Open Source dependency check - Analyzes the open source dependencies such as OS packages, libraries, etc., to identify potential risks. Tools such as BlackDuck, Snyk, WhiteSource Bolt for GitHub, and similar can be leveraged for open source dependency analysis of IaC.</li> <li>Container image scan - Image scanning refers to the process of analyzing the contents and the build process of a container image in order to detect security issues, vulnerabilities or potential risks. Open-source tools such as Dagda, Clair, Trivy, Anchore, etc., can be leveraged for container image analysis. CI/CD pipeline and Consolidated reporting - enabling the security checks to be made available in the CI/CD pipeline enables the analysis of each of the code changes, excludes the need for manual intervention, and enables maintaining the history of compliance. Along with consolidated reporting, these integrations enhance the speed of development of a secure IaC codebase. Open-source tools such as Jenkins, etc., can be leveraged to build the CI/CD pipelines, and DefectDojo and OWASP Glue can help in tying the checks together and visualizing the check results in a single dashboard.</li> <li>Artifact signing - Digital signing of artifacts at build time and validation of the signed data before use protects artifacts from tampering between build and runtime, thus ensuring the integrity and provenance of an artifact. Open-source tools such as TUF helps in the digital signing of artifacts.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Infrastructure_as_Code_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#deploy","title":"Deploy","text":"<ul> <li>Inventory management:<ul> <li>Commissioning - whenever a resource is deployed, ensure the resource is labeled, tracked and logged as part of the inventory management.</li> <li>Decommissioning - whenever a resource deletion is initiated, ensure the underlying configurations are erased, data is securely deleted and the resource is completely removed from the runtime as well as from the inventory management.</li> <li>Tagging - It is essential to tag cloud assets properly. During IaC operations, untagged assets are most likely to result in ghost resources that make it difficult to detect, visualize, and gain observability within the cloud environment and can affect the posture causing a drift. These ghost resources can add to billing costs, make maintenance difficult, and affect the reliability. The only solution to this is careful tagging and monitoring for untagged resources.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Dynamic analysis - Dynamic analysis helps in evaluating any existing environments and services that it will interoperate with or run on. This helps in uncovering potential risks due to the interoperability. Open-source tools such as ZAP, Burp, GVM, etc., can be leveraged for dynamic analysis.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Infrastructure_as_Code_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#runtime","title":"Runtime","text":"<ul> <li>Immutability of infrastructure - The idea behind immutable infrastructure is to build the infrastructure components to an exact set of specifications. No deviation, no changes. If a change to a specification is required, then a whole new set of infrastructure is provisioned based on the updated requirements, and the previous infrastructure is taken out of service as obsolete.</li> <li>Logging - Keeping a record is a critical aspect to keeping an eye on risks. You should enable logging - both security logs and audit logs - while provisioning infrastructure, as they help assess the security risks related to sensitive assets. They also assist in analyzing the root cause of incidents and in identifying potential threats. Open-source tools such as ELK, etc., can be leveraged for log analysis.</li> <li>Monitoring - Continuous monitoring assists in looking out for any security and compliance violations, helps in identifying attacks and also provides alerts upon such incidents. Certain solutions also incorporate new technologies like AI to identify potential threats early. Open-source tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, etc., can be leveraged for monitoring of cloud infrastructure.</li> <li>Runtime threat detection: Implementing a runtime threat detection solution helps in recognizing unexpected application behavior and alerts on threats at runtime. Open-source tools such as Falco, etc., can be leveraged for runtime threat detection. Certain application such as Contrast (Contrast Community Edition) can also detect OWASP Top 10 attacks on the application during runtime and help block them in order to protect and secure the application.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Infrastructure_as_Code_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>Securing Infrastructure as code: https://www.opcito.com/blogs/securing-infrastructure-as-code</li> <li>Infrastructure as code security: https://dzone.com/articles/infrastructure-as-code-security</li> <li>Shifting cloud security left with infrastructure as code: https://securityboulevard.com/2020/04/shifting-cloud-security-left-with-infrastructure-as-code/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html","title":"Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This article is focused on providing clear, simple, actionable guidance for preventing the entire category of Injection flaws in your applications.

For more information on LDAP Injection attacks, visit\u00a0LDAP injection.</p> <p>LDAP injection\u00a0attacks are common due to two factors:</p> <ol> <li>The lack of safer, parameterized LDAP query interfaces</li> <li>The widespread use of LDAP to authenticate users to systems.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#how-to-test-for-the-issue_1","title":"How to test for the issue","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#during-code-review_1","title":"During code review","text":"<p>Please check for any queries to the LDAP escape special characters, see here.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#automated-exploitation_1","title":"Automated Exploitation","text":"<p>Scanner module of tool like OWASP ZAP have module to detect LDAP injection issue.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#remediation_1","title":"Remediation","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#escape-all-variables-using-the-right-ldap-encoding-function","title":"Escape all variables using the right LDAP encoding function","text":"<p>The main way LDAP stores names is based on DN (distinguished name).

This information could have been provided by, or changed by, an unauthorized entity that knows the key.

Legacy applications often introduce significant security risks to an organization for the following reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Legacy applications might have reached End-of-Life (EoL) meaning that the application no longer receives patching or vendor support. This drastically increases the risk of vulnerability in the application being left in an exploitable state.</li> <li>Some applications have been built using technologies that are no longer conventionally used or taught to technical staff. This can mean that the knowledge required to troubleshoot or fix vulnerabilities when they arise may be lacking.</li> <li>Legacy applications may produce data in custom formats and/or use old interfaces or networking protocols.

Ideally, this will include details regarding what network hosts need to be situated on to reach the application and associated infrastructure. A record of the services running on infrastructure used for hosting the application and/or for data storage should also be outlined. In some circumstances documentation could include information about the physical location of and permitted access to servers associated with the application. Organizations might opt to generate a formal SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) as part of this process. SBOMs serve a useful role when an application relies on third-party dependencies in order to function.</p> <p>Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling: Ensure your organization has a clear understanding of the level of risk and the kinds of threats theoretically posed by using the legacy application and its specific components (e.g. specific API routes or open ports on hosting infrastructure). This may be informed by formal or informal threat-modeling of an application, as described in the Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet. Qualifying the risk posed by legacy software might also be aided by using an industry standard risk assessment framework, such as the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Risk Management Framework. There are many threat modeling and risk assessment frameworks and tools that have different strengths and weaknesses.</p> <p>As a more informal indicator of how conservative security measures used to protect the application ought to be, consider the questions below.

Consider implementing the following as applicable:</p> <ul> <li>Apply network-level access controls to the application. This might entail hosting the application within a restricted subnet and/or applying IP allow-listing to prevent arbitrary users from interacting particularly with public-facing legacy applications from arbitrary hosts. In some circumstances the application may be required to run in an air-gapped environment.</li> <li>Authorization controls could be considered at a more granular level by reducing the feature set available to end users. For example, it might be necessary to disable certain high risk functionalities, particularly administrative functionalities.</li> <li>Ensure that only authenticated users can access the application. This could be enforced by the application itself, or by use of an IdP (Identity Provider) service. If the application is hosted in a restricted network environment, authentication should also be required to access this network environment (e.g. users could be required to authenticate to a VPN server before accessing the application). Implementing one or more of these controls will both slow down an attacker and assist with investigations if an incident were to occur. See the Authentication Cheat Sheet for further information regarding authentication controls.</li> <li>Close any ports on hosts used to run the application that are not strictly needed in order for the application to perform only the tasks required of it by your organization. Access to certain ports may also be restricted using firewall/application firewall rules to lock down server infrastructure.</li> <li>In some circumstances it may be possible to restrict almost all users from directly accessing the legacy application by developing an intermediary service (e.g. a separate set of APIs) that handles essential movement of data into and out of the legacy application without an end user having any requirement to interact directly with the legacy application.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Legacy_Application_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#vulnerability-management","title":"Vulnerability Management","text":"<p>Vulnerability Scanning: Legacy applications should be subject to regular vulnerability scanning with an industry standard vulnerability assessment tool, where possible, such as Nessus and Qualys.

The five types are as follows:</p> Factor Examples Something You Know Passwords and PINs, Security Questions Something You Have OTP Tokens, U2F Tokens, Certificates,Smart Cards, Email, SMS and Phone Calls Something You Are Fingerprints, Facial Recognition, Iris Scans Somewhere You Are Source IP Address, Geolocation, Geofencing Something You Do Behavioral Profiling, Keystroke &amp; Mouse Dynamics, Gait Analysis <p>It should be noted that requiring multiple instances of the same authentication factor (such as needing both a password and a PIN) does not constitute MFA and offers minimal additional security. The factors used should be independent of each other and should not be able to be compromised by the same attack. While the following sections discuss the disadvantage and weaknesses of various different types of MFA, in many cases these are only relevant against targeted attacks.

All of the following and their variants are bad patterns you should avoid:</p> <ul> <li><code>CMD \u201cnpm\u201d \u201cstart\u201d</code></li> <li><code>CMD [\u201cyarn\u201d, \u201cstart\u201d]</code></li> <li><code>CMD \u201cnode\u201d \u201cserver.js\u201d</code></li> <li><code>CMD \u201cstart-app.sh\u201d</code></li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s dig in! I\u2019ll walk you through the differences between them and why they\u2019re all patterns to avoid.</p> <p>The following concerns are key to understanding the context for properly running and terminating Node.js Docker applications:</p> <ol> <li>An orchestration engine, such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, or even just Docker engine itself, needs a way to send signals to the process in the container. Mostly, these are signals to terminate an application, such as <code>SIGTERM</code> and <code>SIGKILL</code>.</li> <li>The process may run indirectly, and if that happens then it\u2019s not always guaranteed that it will receive these signals.</li> <li>The Linux kernel treats processes that run as process ID 1 (PID) differently than any other process ID.</li> </ol> <p>Equipped with that knowledge, let\u2019s begin investigating the ways of invoking the process for a container, starting off with the example from the Dockerfile we\u2019re building:</p> <p><code>CMD \"npm\" \"start\"</code></p> <p>The caveat here is two fold. Firstly, we\u2019re indirectly running the node application by directly invoking the npm client. Who\u2019s to say that the npm CLI forwards all events to the node runtime? It actually doesn\u2019t, and we can easily test that.</p> <p>Make sure that in your Node.js application you set an event handler for the <code>SIGHUP</code> signal which logs to the console every time you\u2019re sending an event. A simple code example should look as follows:</p> <pre><code>function handle(signal) {\n   console.log(`*^!@4=&gt; Received event: ${signal}`)\n}\nprocess.on('SIGHUP', handle)\n</code></pre> <p>Then run the container, and once it\u2019s up specifically send it the <code>SIGHUP</code> signal using the <code>docker</code> CLI and the special <code>--signal</code> command-line flag:</p> <p><code>$ docker kill --signal=SIGHUP elastic_archimedes</code></p> <p>Nothing happened, right? That\u2019s because the npm client doesn\u2019t forward any signals to the node process that it spawned.</p> <p>The other caveat has to do with the different ways in which way you can specify the <code>CMD</code> directive in the Dockerfile. There are two ways, and they are not the same:</p> <ol> <li>the shellform notation, in which the container spawns a shell interpreter that wraps the process. In such cases, the shell may not properly forward signals to your process.</li> <li>the execform notation, which directly spawns a process without wrapping it in a shell. It is specified using the JSON array notation, such as: <code>CMD [\u201cnpm\u201d, \u201cstart\u201d]</code>. Any signals sent to the container are directly sent to the process.</li> </ol> <p>Based on that knowledge, we want to improve our Dockerfile process execution directive as follows:</p> <p><code>CMD [\"node\", \"server.js\"]</code></p> <p>We are now invoking the node process directly, ensuring that it receives all of the signals sent to it, without it being wrapped in a shell interpreter.</p> <p>However, this introduces another pitfall.</p> <p>When processes run as PID 1 they effectively take on some of the responsibilities of an init system, which is typically responsible for initializing an operating system and processes. The kernel treats PID 1 in a different way than it treats other process identifiers. This special treatment from the kernel means that the handling of a <code>SIGTERM</code> signal to a running process won\u2019t invoke a default fallback behavior of killing the process if the process doesn\u2019t already set a handler for it.</p> <p>To quote the Node.js Docker working group recommendation on this:\u00a0 \u201cNode.js was not designed to run as PID 1 which leads to unexpected behaviour when running inside of Docker. For example, a Node.js process running as PID 1 will not respond to SIGINT (CTRL-C) and similar signals\u201d.</p> <p>The way to go about it then is to use a tool that will act like an init process, in that it is invoked with PID 1, then spawns our Node.js application as another process whilst ensuring that all signals are proxied to that Node.js process. If possible, we\u2019d like a small as possible tooling footprint for doing so to not risk having security vulnerabilities added to our container image.</p> <p>One such tool is dumb-init which is statically linked and has a small footprint. Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll set it up:</p> <pre><code>RUN apk add dumb-init\nCMD [\"dumb-init\", \"node\", \"server.js\"]\n</code></pre> <p>This brings us to the following up to date Dockerfile. You\u2019ll notice that we placed the <code>dumb-init</code> package install right after the image declaration, so we can take advantage of Docker\u2019s caching of layers:</p> <pre><code>FROM node:lts-alpine@sha256:b2da3316acdc2bec442190a1fe10dc094e7ba4121d029cb32075ff59bb27390a\nRUN apk add dumb-init\nENV NODE_ENV production\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\nCOPY --chown=node:node . .\nRUN npm ci --omit=dev\nUSER node\nCMD [\"dumb-init\", \"node\", \"server.js\"]\n</code></pre> <p>Good to know: <code>docker kill</code> and <code>docker stop</code> commands only send signals to the container process with PID 1. If you\u2019re running a shell script that runs your Node.js application, then take note that a shell instance\u2014such as <code>/bin/sh</code>, for example\u2014doesn\u2019t forward signals to child processes, which means your app will never get a <code>SIGTERM</code>.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/NodeJS_Docker_Cheat_Sheet.html#6-graceful-tear-down-for-your-nodejs-web-applications","title":"6) Graceful tear down for your Node.js web applications","text":"<p>If we\u2019re already discussing process signals that terminate applications, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re shutting them down properly and gracefully without disrupting users.</p> <p>When a Node.js application receives an interrupt signal, also known as <code>SIGINT</code>, or <code>CTRL+C</code>, it will cause an abrupt process kill, unless any event handlers were set of course to handle it in a different behavior. This means that connected clients to a web application will be immediately disconnected. Now, imagine hundreds of Node.js web containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, going up and down as needs arise to scale or manage errors. Not the greatest user experience.</p> <p>You can easily simulate this problem. Here\u2019s a stock Fastify web application example, with an inherent delayed response of 60 seconds for an endpoint:</p> <pre><code>fastify.get('/delayed', async (request, reply) =&gt; {\n const SECONDS_DELAY = 60000\n await new Promise(resolve =&gt; {\n     setTimeout(() =&gt; resolve(), SECONDS_DELAY)\n })\n return { hello: 'delayed world' }\n})\n\nconst start = async () =&gt; {\n try {\n   await fastify.listen(PORT, HOST)\n   console.log(`*^!@4=&gt; Process id: ${process.pid}`)\n } catch (err) {\n   fastify.log.error(err)\n   process.exit(1)\n }\n}\n\nstart()\n</code></pre> <p>Run this application and once it\u2019s running send a simple HTTP request to this endpoint:</p> <p><code>$ time curl https://localhost:3000/delayed</code></p> <p>Hit <code>CTRL+C</code> in the running Node.js console window and you\u2019ll see that the curl request exited abruptly. This simulates the same experience your users would receive when containers tear down.</p> <p>To provide a better experience, we can do the following:</p> <ol> <li>Set an event handler for the various termination signals like <code>SIGINT</code> and <code>SIGTERM</code>.</li> <li>The handler waits for clean up operations like database connections, ongoing HTTP requests and others.</li> <li>The handler then terminates the Node.js process.</li> </ol> <p>Specifically with Fastify, we can have our handler call on fastify.close() which returns a promise that we will await, and Fastify will also take care to respond to every new connection with the HTTP status code 503 to signal that the application is unavailable.</p> <p>Let\u2019s add our event handler:</p> <pre><code>async function closeGracefully(signal) {\n   console.log(`*^!@4=&gt; Received signal to terminate: ${signal}`)\n\n   await fastify.close()\n   // await db.close() if we have a db connection in this app\n   // await other things we should cleanup nicely\n   process.exit()\n}\nprocess.on('SIGINT', closeGracefully)\nprocess.on('SIGTERM', closeGracefully)\n</code></pre> <p>Admittedly, this is more of a generic web application concern than Dockerfile related, but is even more important in orchestrated environments.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/NodeJS_Docker_Cheat_Sheet.html#7-find-and-fix-security-vulnerabilities-in-your-nodejs-docker-image","title":"7) Find and fix security vulnerabilities in your Node.js docker image","text":"<p>See Docker Security Cheat Sheet - Use static analysis tools</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/NodeJS_Docker_Cheat_Sheet.html#8-use-multi-stage-builds","title":"8) Use multi-stage builds","text":"<p>Multi-stage builds are a great way to move from a simple, yet potentially erroneous Dockerfile, into separated steps of building a Docker image, so we can avoid leaking sensitive information.

However, increasing layers of nesting within callback functions can become a problem. Any multistage process can become nested 10 or more levels deep. This problem is referred to as a \"Pyramid of Doom\" or \"Callback Hell\". In such code, the errors and results get lost within the callback. Promises are a good way to write asynchronous code without getting into nested pyramids. Promises provide top-down execution while being asynchronous by delivering errors and results to next <code>.then</code> function.</p> <p>Another advantage of Promises is the way Promises handle errors. If an error occurs in a Promise class, it skips over the <code>.then</code> functions and invokes the first <code>.catch</code> function it finds. This way Promises provide a higher assurance of capturing and handling errors. As a principle, you can make all your asynchronous code (apart from emitters) return promises. It should be noted that Promise calls can also become a pyramid. In order to completely stay away from \"Callback Hell\", flat Promise chains should be used.

If there is no limit on the size of requests, attackers can send requests with large request bodies that can exhaust server memory and/or fill disk space.

Node.js has a single-thread event-driven architecture. By means of this architecture, throughput becomes high and the programming model becomes simpler. Node.js is implemented around a non-blocking I/O event loop. With this event loop, there is no waiting on I/O or context switching. The event loop looks for events and dispatches them to handler functions. Because of this, when CPU intensive JavaScript operations are executed, the event loop waits for them to finish. This is why such operations are called \"blocking\". To overcome this problem, Node.js allows assigning callbacks to IO-blocked events. This way, the main application is not blocked and callbacks run asynchronously. Therefore, as a general principle, all blocking operations should be done asynchronously so that the event loop is not blocked.</p> <p>Even if you perform blocking operations asynchronously, your application may still not serve as expected. This happens if there is a code outside the callback that relies on the code within the callback to run first. For example, consider the following code:</p> <pre><code>const fs = require('fs');\nfs.readFile('/file.txt', (err, data) =&gt; {\n  // perform actions on file content\n});\nfs.unlinkSync('/file.txt');\n</code></pre> <p>In the above example, <code>unlinkSync</code> function may run before the callback, which will delete the file before the desired actions on the file content is done. Such race conditions can also affect the security of your application. An example would be a scenario where authentication is performed in a callback and authenticated actions are run synchronously. In order to eliminate such race conditions, you can write all operations that rely on each other in a single non-blocking function. By doing so, you can guarantee that all operations are executed in the correct order. For example, above code example can be written in a non-blocking way as follows:</p> <pre><code>const fs = require('fs');\nfs.readFile('/file.txt', (err, data) =&gt; {\n  // perform actions on file content\n  fs.unlink('/file.txt', (err) =&gt; {\n    if (err) throw err;\n  });\n});\n</code></pre> <p>In the above code, call to unlink the file and other file operations are within the same callback.

Sample usage of these flags is given in the following example:</p> <pre><code>const session = require('express-session');\napp.use(session({\n    secret: 'your-secret-key',\n    name: 'cookieName',\n    cookie: { secure: true, httpOnly: true, path: '/user', sameSite: true}\n}));\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#use-appropriate-security-headers","title":"Use appropriate security headers","text":"<p>There are several HTTP security headers that can help you prevent some common attack vectors. The helmet package can help to set those headers:</p> <pre><code>const express = require(\"express\");\nconst helmet = require(\"helmet\");\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(helmet()); // Add various HTTP headers\n</code></pre> <p>The top-level <code>helmet</code> function is a wrapper around 14 smaller middlewares. Bellow is a list of HTTP security headers covered by <code>helmet</code> middlewares:</p> <ul> <li>Strict-Transport-Security: HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) dictates browsers that the application can only be accessed via HTTPS connections. In order to use it in your application, add the following codes:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.hsts()); // default configuration\napp.use(\n  helmet.hsts({\n    maxAge: 123456,\n    includeSubDomains: false,\n  })\n); // custom configuration\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>X-Frame-Options: determines if a page can be loaded via a <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code> or an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> element. Allowing the page to be framed may result in Clickjacking attacks.</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.frameguard()); // default behavior (SAMEORIGIN)\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>X-XSS-Protection: stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This header has been deprecated by modern browsers and its use can introduce additional security issues on the client side. As such, it is recommended to set the header as X-XSS-Protection: 0 in order to disable the XSS Auditor, and not allow it to take the default behavior of the browser handling the response.</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.xssFilter()); // sets \"X-XSS-Protection: 0\"\n</code></pre> <p>For moderns browsers, it is recommended to implement a strong Content-Security-Policy policy, as detailed in the next section.</p> <ul> <li>Content-Security-Policy: Content Security Policy is developed to reduce the risk of attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking. It allows content from a list that you decide. It has several directives each of which prohibits loading specific type of a content. You can refer to Content Security Policy Cheat Sheet for detailed explanation of each directive and how to use it. You can implement these settings in your application as follows:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(\n  helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({\n    // the following directives will be merged into the default helmet CSP policy\n    directives: {\n      defaultSrc: [\"'self'\"],  // default value for all directives that are absent\n      scriptSrc: [\"'self'\"],   // helps prevent XSS attacks\n      frameAncestors: [\"'none'\"],  // helps prevent Clickjacking attacks\n      imgSrc: [\"'self'\", \"'http://imgexample.com'\"],\n      styleSrc: [\"'none'\"]\n    }\n  })\n);\n</code></pre> <p>As this middleware performs very little validation, it is recommended to rely on CSP checkers like CSP Evaluator instead.</p> <ul> <li>X-Content-Type-Options: Even if the server sets a valid <code>Content-Type</code> header in the response, browsers may try to sniff the MIME type of the requested resource. This header is a way to stop this behavior and tell the browser not to change MIME types specified in <code>Content-Type</code> header. It can be configured in the following way:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.noSniff());\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Cache-Control and Pragma: Cache-Control header can be used to prevent browsers from caching the given responses. This should be done for pages that contain sensitive information about either the user or the application. However, disabling caching for pages that do not contain sensitive information may seriously affect the performance of the application. Therefore, caching should only be disabled for pages that return sensitive information. Appropriate caching controls and headers can be set easily using the nocache package:</li> </ul> <pre><code>const nocache = require(\"nocache\");\n\napp.use(nocache());\n</code></pre> <p>The above code sets Cache-Control, Surrogate-Control, Pragma and Expires headers accordingly.</p> <ul> <li>X-Download-Options: This header prevents Internet Explorer from executing downloaded files in the site's context. This is achieved with noopen directive. You can do so with the following piece of code:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.ieNoOpen());\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Expect-CT: Certificate Transparency is a new mechanism developed to fix some structural problems regarding current SSL infrastructure. Expect-CT header may enforce certificate transparency requirements. It can be implemented in your application as follows:</li> </ul> <pre><code>const expectCt = require('expect-ct');\napp.use(expectCt({ maxAge: 123 }));\napp.use(expectCt({ enforce: true, maxAge: 123 }));\napp.use(expectCt({ enforce: true, maxAge: 123, reportUri: 'http://example.com'}));\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>X-Powered-By: X-Powered-By header is used to inform what technology is used in the server side. This is an unnecessary header causing information leakage, so it should be removed from your application. To do so, you can use the <code>hidePoweredBy</code> as follows:</li> </ul> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy());\n</code></pre> <p>Also, you can lie about the technologies used with this header. For example, even if your application does not use PHP, you can set X-Powered-By header to seem so.</p> <pre><code>app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }));\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#platform-security","title":"Platform Security","text":""},{"location":"cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#keep-your-packages-up-to-date","title":"Keep your packages up-to-date","text":"<p>Security of your application depends directly on how secure the third-party packages you use in your application are.

Although secure, this approach is not particularly user-friendly. Expiring the passwords of many users may cause issues for support staff or may be interpreted by users as an indication of a breach.</p> <p>Upgrade Method Two: Use the existing password hashes as inputs for a more secure algorithm.

While REST is more widely applicable, it is most commonly used within the context of communicating with services via HTTP.</p> <p>The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource. A REST API resource is identified by a URI, usually a HTTP URL. REST components use connectors to perform actions on a resource by using a representation to capture the current or intended state of the resource and transferring that representation.</p> <p>The primary connector types are client and server, secondary connectors include cache, resolver and tunnel.</p> <p>REST APIs are stateless. Stateful APIs do not adhere to the REST architectural style. State in the REST acronym refers to the state of the resource which the API accesses, not the state of a session within which the API is called. While there may be good reasons for building a stateful API, it is important to realize that managing sessions is complex and difficult to do securely.</p> <p>Stateful services are out of scope of this Cheat Sheet: Passing state from client to backend, while making the service technically stateless, is an anti-pattern that should also be avoided as it is prone to replay and impersonation attacks.</p> <p>In order to implement flows with REST APIs, resources are typically created, read, updated and deleted. For example, an ecommerce site may offer methods to create an empty shopping cart, to add items to the cart and to check out the cart. Each of these REST calls is stateless and the endpoint should check whether the caller is authorized to perform the requested operation.</p> <p>Another key feature of REST applications is the use of standard HTTP verbs and error codes in the pursuit or removing unnecessary variation among different services.</p> <p>Another key feature of REST applications is the use of HATEOAS or Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State. This provides REST applications a self-documenting nature making it easier for developers to interact with a REST service without prior knowledge.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#https","title":"HTTPS","text":"<p>Secure REST services must only provide HTTPS endpoints.

When an explicit session termination event occurs, a digest or hash of any associated JWTs should be submitted to a denylist on the API which will invalidate that JWT for any requests until the expiration of the token.

However, some of these headers are intended to be used with HTML responses, and as such may provide little or no security benefits on an API that does not return HTML.</p> <p>The following headers should be included in all API responses:</p> Header Rationale <code>Cache-Control: no-store</code> Header used to direct caching done by browsers. Providing <code>no-store</code> indicates that any caches of any kind (private or shared) should not store the response that contains the header. A browser must make a new request everytime the API is called to fetch the latest response. This header with a <code>no-store</code> value prevents sensitive information from being cached or stored. <code>Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'</code> Header used to specify whether a response can be framed in a <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element. For an API response, there is no requirement to be framed in any of those elements. Providing <code>frame-ancestors 'none'</code> prevents any domain from framing the response returned by the API call. This header protects against drag-and-drop style clickjacking attacks. <code>Content-Type</code> Header to specify the content type of a response. This must be specified as per the type of content returned by an API call. If not specified or if specified incorrectly, a browser might attempt to guess the content type of the response. This can return in MIME sniffing attacks. One common content type value is <code>application/json</code> if the API response is JSON. <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> Header to instruct a browser that the domain should only be accessed using HTTPS, and that any future attempts to access it using HTTP should automatically be converted to HTTPS. This header ensures that API calls are made over HTTPS and protects against spoofed certificates. <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code> Header to instruct a browser to always use the MIME type that is declared in the <code>Content-Type</code> header rather than trying to determine the MIME type based on the file's content. This header with a <code>nosniff</code> value prevents browsers from performing MIME sniffing, and inappropriately interpreting responses as HTML. <code>X-Frame-Options: DENY</code> Header used to specify whether a response can be framed in a <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> element. For an API response, there is no requirement to be framed in any of those elements. Providing <code>DENY</code> prevents any domain from framing the response returned by the API call. This header with a <code>DENY</code> value protects protect against drag-and-drop style clickjacking attacks. <p>The headers below are only intended to provide additional security when responses are rendered as HTML. As such, if the API will never return HTML in responses, then these headers may not be necessary. However, if there is any uncertainty about the function of the headers, or the types of information that the API returns (or may return in future), then it is recommended to include them as part of a defence-in-depth approach.</p> Header Example Rationale Content-Security-Policy <code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'</code> The majority of CSP functionality only affects pages rendered as HTML. Permissions-Policy <code>Permissions-Policy: accelerometer=(), ambient-light-sensor=(), autoplay=(), battery=(), camera=(), cross-origin-isolated=(), display-capture=(), document-domain=(), encrypted-media=(), execution-while-not-rendered=(), execution-while-out-of-viewport=(), fullscreen=(), geolocation=(), gyroscope=(), keyboard-map=(), magnetometer=(), microphone=(), midi=(), navigation-override=(), payment=(), picture-in-picture=(), publickey-credentials-get=(), screen-wake-lock=(), sync-xhr=(), usb=(), web-share=(), xr-spatial-tracking=()</code> This header used to be named Feature-Policy.

You often find poorly maintained secrets where the needs of secret consumers or producers mismatch. Therefore, you must standardize and centralize the secrets management solution with care. Standardizing and centralizing can mean that you use multiple secret management solutions. For instance: your cloud-native development teams choose to use the solution provided by the cloud provider, while your private cloud uses a third-party solution, and everybody has an account for a selected password manager. By making sure that the teams standardize the interaction with these different solutions, they remain maintainable and usable in the event of an incident. Even when a company centralizes its secrets management to just one solution, you will often have to secure the primary secret of that secrets management solution in a secondary secrets management solution.

Because of this potential implementation complexity, you are first encouraged to develop a threat model in order to clearly surface your implicit assumptions about both your application's deployment environment as well as understanding the capabilities of your adversaries.</p> <p>Often attempting to protect secrets in memory will be considered overkill because as you evaluate a threat model, the potential threat actors that you consider either do not have the capabilities to carry out such attacks or the cost of defense far exceeds the likely impact of a compromise arising from exposing secrets in memory. Also, it should be kept in mind while developing an appropriate threat model, that if an attacker already has access to the memory of the process handling the secret, by that time a security breach may have already occurred. Furthermore, it should be recognized that with the advent of attacks like Rowhammer, or Meltdown and Spectre, it is important to understand that the operating system alone is not sufficient to protect your process memory from these types of attacks. This becomes especially important when your application is deployed to the cloud. The only foolproof approach to protecting memory against these and similar attacks to fully physically isolate your process memory from all other untrusted processes.</p> <p>Despite the implementation difficulties, in highly sensitive environments, protecting secrets in memory can be a valuable additional layer of security. For example, in scenarios where an advanced attacker can cause a system to crash and gain access to a memory dump, they may be able to extract secrets from it. Therefore, carefully safeguarding secrets in memory is recommended for untrusted environments or situations where tight security is of utmost importance.</p> <p>Furthermore, in lower level languages like C/C++, it is relatively easy to protect secrets in memory. Thus, it may be worthwhile to implement this practice even if the risk of an attacker gaining access to the memory is low. On the other hand, for programming languages that rely on garbage collection, securing secrets in memory generally is much more difficult.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Structures and Classes: In .NET and Java, do not use immutable structures     such as Strings to store secrets, since it is impossible to force them to     be garbage collected. Instead use primitive types such as byte arrays or     char arrays, where the memory can be directly overwritten. You can also     use Java's     GuardedString     or .NET's     SecureString     which are designed to solve precisely this problem.</p> </li> <li> <p>Zeroing Memory: After a secret has been used, the memory it occupied   should be zeroed out to prevent it from lingering in memory where it could   potentially be accessed.</p> <ul> <li>If using Java's GuardedString, call the <code>dispose()</code> method.</li> <li>If using .NET's SecureString, call the <code>Dispose()</code> method.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Memory Encryption: In some cases, it may be possible to use hardware or   operating system features to encrypt the entire memory space of the process   handling the secret. This can provide an additional layer of security. For   example, GuardedString in Java encrypts the values in memory, and SecureString   in .NET does so on Windows.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Remember, the goal is to minimize the time window where the secret is in plaintext in memory as much as possible.</p> <p>For more detailed information, see Testing Memory for Sensitive Data from the OWASP MAS project.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#26-auditing","title":"2.6 Auditing","text":"<p>Auditing is an essential part of secrets management due to the nature of the application.

Therefore, sessions provide the ability to establish variables \u2013 such as access rights and localization settings \u2013 which will apply to each and every interaction a user has with the web application for the duration of the session.</p> <p>Web applications can create sessions to keep track of anonymous users after the very first user request. An example would be maintaining the user language preference. Additionally, web applications will make use of sessions once the user has authenticated. This ensures the ability to identify the user on any subsequent requests as well as being able to apply security access controls, authorized access to the user private data, and to increase the usability of the application. Therefore, current web applications can provide session capabilities both pre and post authentication.</p> <p>Once an authenticated session has been established, the session ID (or token) is temporarily equivalent to the strongest authentication method used by the application, such as username and password, passphrases, one-time passwords (OTP), client-based digital certificates, smartcards, or biometrics (such as fingerprint or eye retina). See the OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet.</p> <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol (RFC2616 section 5), where each request and response pair is independent of other web interactions. Therefore, in order to introduce the concept of a session, it is required to implement session management capabilities that link both the authentication and access control (or authorization) modules commonly available in web applications:</p> <p></p> <p>The session ID or token binds the user authentication credentials (in the form of a user session) to the user HTTP traffic and the appropriate access controls enforced by the web application. The complexity of these three components (authentication, session management, and access control) in modern web applications, plus the fact that its implementation and binding resides on the web developer's hands (as web development frameworks do not provide strict relationships between these modules), makes the implementation of a secure session management module very challenging.</p> <p>The disclosure, capture, prediction, brute force, or fixation of the session ID will lead to session hijacking (or sidejacking) attacks, where an attacker is able to fully impersonate a victim user in the web application. Attackers can perform two types of session hijacking attacks, targeted or generic. In a targeted attack, the attacker's goal is to impersonate a specific (or privileged) web application victim user.

From a developer's perspective, these steps span the entire SDLC and are accomplished using a wide range of components and tools. Common examples (by no means exhaustive) of components that are especially relevant from a developer's perspective include:</p> <ul> <li>IDEs and code editors</li> <li>Internally developed source code</li> <li>Third-party software libraries</li> <li>Version control systems (VCS)</li> <li>Build tools (Maven, Rake, make, Grunt, etc.)</li> <li>CI/CD software (Jenkins, CircleCI, TeamCity, etc.)</li> <li>Configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet, Chef, etc.)</li> <li>Package management software and ecosystems (pip, npm, Composer, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>Each of these components must be secured; a flaw in a single component, such as a vulnerable third-party dependency or misconfigured VCS, can put an entire SSC in jeopardy.

Threats include dependency confusion, compromise of an upstream providers infrastructure, theft of code signing certificates, and CI/CD system exploits. More broadly, threats may be grouped into four categories based upon what component of the supply chain they seek to compromise [4,5]:</p> <ul> <li>Source code threats. These type of threats focus on violating the integrity of a source code which is then built and and deployed or potentially consumed by other software projects. Threats in this category include VCS exploits, the introduction of malicious or vulnerable code into a code base, or building code from an unauthorized branch.</li> <li>Build environment threats. These threats modify a software artifact but without altering the underlying source code or exploiting the build process itself. Examples include build cache poisoning, compromising a privileged account used by the build system, or publishing software built from an untrusted source.</li> <li>Dependency related threats. Threats that result from the consumption of both direct and transitive software dependencies. The most common threat is using a vulnerable or compromised dependency.</li> <li>Deployment and runtime threats. These threats exploit either the deployment process or runtime environment. Common examples include compromising a privilege CI/CD account, software misconfigurations, and deployment of compromised binaries.</li> </ul> <p>The characteristics of threat actors seeking exploit the SSC are similarly diverse. Although SSC compromise is often associated with highly sophisticated threat actors, such sophistication is not inherently necessary for attacking the SSC, especially if the attack focuses on compromising the SSC of entities with poor security practices. Threat actor motive also varies widely, A SSC exploit can result in loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of any organization's assets and thus fulfill a wide range of attacker goals such as espionage or financial gain.</p> <p>Finally, it must be recognized that many SSC threats have the capability to propagate across many entities. This is due to consumer-supplier relationship that is integral to an SSC. For example, uf a large-scale software supplier, whether proprietary or open-source, is compromised, many downstream, consuming entities could also be impacted as a result.

No interaction is needed with the third parties; they continue getting the data they expect but now it comes from different contexts that the host marketing technologists have chosen.</p> <p>Changing third party vendors just means changing the data dissemination rules at the tag manager server, no changes are needed in the host code.

Threat modeling analyzes a system from an adversarial perspective, focusing on ways in which an attacker can exploit a system.</p> <p>Threat modeling is ideally performed early in the SDLC, such as during the design phase. Moreover, it is not something that is performed once and never again. A threat model is something that should be maintained, updated and refined alongside the system. Ideally, threat modeling should be integrated seamlessly into a team's normal SDLC process; it should be treated as standard and necessary step in the process, not an add-on.</p> <p>According to the Threat Modeling Manifesto, the threat modeling process should answer the following four questions:</p> <ol> <li>What are we working on?</li> <li>What can go wrong?</li> <li>What are we going to do about it?</li> <li>Did we do a good enough job?</li> </ol> <p>These four questions will act as the foundation for the four major phases described below.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html#advantages","title":"Advantages","text":"<p>Before turning to an overview of the process, it may be worth addressing the question: why threat model?

DFDs may be created within dedicated threat modeling tools such as OWASP's Threat Dragon or Microsoft's Threat Modeling Tool or using general purpose diagraming solutions such as draw.io. If you prefer an -as-code approach, OWASP's pytm can help there. Depending on the scale and complexity of the system being modeled, multiple DFDs may be required. For example, one could create a DFD representing a high-level overview of the entire system along with a number of more focused DFDs which detail sub-systems. Technical tools are not strictly necessary; whiteboarding may be sufficient in some instances, though it is preferable to have the DFDs in a form that can be easily stored, referenced, and updated as needed.</p> <p>Regardless of how a DFD or comparable model is generated, it is important that the solution provides a clear view of trust boundaries, data flows, data stores, processes, and the external entities which may interact with the system. These often represent possible attack points and provide crucial input for the subsequent steps.</p> <p>Another approach to Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) could be the brainstorming technique, which is an effective method for generating ideas and discovering the project's domain. Applying brainstorming in this context can bring numerous benefits, such as increased team engagement, unification of knowledge and terminology, a shared understanding of the domain, and quick identification of key processes and dependencies. One of the main arguments for using brainstorming is its flexibility and adaptability to almost any scenario, including business logic. Additionally, this technique is particularly useful when less technical individuals participate in the session, as it eliminates barriers related to understanding and applying the components of DFD models and their correctness.</p> <p>Brainstorming engages all participants, fostering better communication and mutual understanding of issues. Every team member has the opportunity to contribute, which increases the sense of responsibility and involvement. During a brainstorming session, participants can collaboratively define and agree on key terms and concepts, leading to a unified language used in the project. This is especially important in complex projects where different teams might have different approaches to terminology. Due to the dynamic nature of brainstorming, the team can quickly identify key business processes and their interrelations.</p> <p>Integrating the results of brainstorming with formal modeling techniques can lead to a better understanding of the domain and more effective system design.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html#threat-identification","title":"Threat Identification","text":"<p>After the system has been modeled, it is now time to address the question of \"what can go wrong?\". This question must be explored with the inputs from the first step in mind; that is, it should focus on identifying and ranking threats within the context of the specific system being evaluated. In attempting to answer this question, threat modelers have a wealth of data sources and techniques at their disposal. For illustration purposes, this cheatsheet will leverage STRIDE; however, in practice, other approaches may be used alongside or instead of STRIDE.</p> <p>STRIDE is a mature and popular threat modeling technique and mnemonic originally developed by Microsoft employees. To facilitate threat identification, STRIDE groups threats into one of six general prompts and engineers are encouraged to systematically consider how these general threats may materialize within the context of the specific system being evaluated. Each STRIDE threat may be considered a violation of a desirable security attribute; the categories and associated desirable attributes are are as follows:</p> Threat Category Violates Examples Spoofing Authenticity An attacker steals the authentication token of a legitimate user and uses it to impersonate the user. Tampering Integrity An attacker abuses the application to perform unintended updates to a database. Repudiation Non-repudiability An attacker manipulates logs to cover their actions. Information Disclosure Confidentiality An attacker extract data from a database containing user account info. Denial of Service Availability An attacker locks a legitimate user out of their account by performing many failed authentication attempts. Elevation of Privileges Authorization An attacker tampers with a JWT to change their role. <p>STRIDE provides valuable structure for responding to the question of \"what can go wrong\". It is also a highly flexible approach and getting started need not be complex. Simple techniques such as brainstorming and whiteboarding or even games may be used initially. STRIDE is also incorporated into popular threat modeling tools such as OWASP's Threat Dragon and Microsoft's Threat Modeling Tool. Additionally, as a relatively high-level process, STRIDE pairs well with more tactical approaches such as kill chains or MITRE's ATT&amp;CK (please refer to this article for an overview of how STRIDE and ATT&amp;CK can work together).</p> <p>After possible threats have been identified, people will frequently rank them. In theory, ranking should be based on the mathematical product of an identified threat's likelihood and its impact. A threat that is likely to occur and result in serious damage would be prioritized much higher than one that is unlikely to occur and would only have a moderate impact. However, these both can be challenging to calculate, and they ignore the work to fix a problem. Some advocate for including that in a single prioritization.</p>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html#response-and-mitigations","title":"Response and Mitigations","text":"<p>Equipped with an understanding of both the system and applicable threats, it is now time to answer \"what are we going to do about it\"?. Each threat identified earlier must have a response. Threat responses are similar, but not identical, to risk responses.

Depending on the complexity of the system, nature of threats identified, and the process used for identifying threats (STRIDE or another method), mitigation responses may be applied at either the category or individual threat level. In the former case, the mitigation would apply to all threats within that category. Mitigations strategies must be actionable not hypothetical; they must be something that can actually be built into to the system being developed.

You need to do a number of things to setup the virtual patching processes and framework prior to actually having to deal with an identified vulnerability, or worse yet, react to a live web application intrusion. The point is that during a live compromise is not the ideal time to be proposing installation of a web application firewall and the concept of a virtual patch. Tension is high during real incidents and time is of the essence, so lay the foundation of virtual patching when the waters are calm and get everything in place and ready to go when an incident does occur.</p> <p>Here are a few critical items that should be addressed during the preparation phase:</p> <ul> <li>Public/Vendor Vulnerability Monitoring - Ensure that you are signed up for all vendor alert mail-lists for commercial software that you are using. This will ensure that you will be notified in the event that the vendor releases vulnerability information and patching data.</li> <li>Virtual Patching Pre-Authorization \u2013 Virtual Patches need to be implemented quickly so the normal governance processes and authorizations steps for standard software patches need to be expedited. Since virtual patches are not actually modifying source code, they do not require the same amount of regression testing as normal software patches. Categorizing virtual patches in the same group as Anti-Virus updates or Network IDS signatures helps to speed up the authorization process and minimize extended testing phases.</li> <li>Deploy Virtual Patching Tool In Advance - As time is critical during incident response, it would be a poor time to have to get approvals to install new software. For instance, you can install ModSecurity WAF in embedded mode on your Apache servers, or an Apache reverse proxy server. The advantage with this deployment is that you can create fixes for non-Apache back-end servers. Even if you do not use ModSecurity under normal circumstances, it is best to have it \"on deck\" ready to be enabled if need be.</li> <li>Increase HTTP Audit Logging \u2013 The standard Common Log Format (CLF) utilized by most web servers does not provide adequate data for conducting proper incident response. You need to have access to the following HTTP data:<ul> <li>Request URI (including QUERY_STRING)</li> <li>Full Request Headers (including Cookies)</li> <li>Full Request Body (POST payload)</li> <li>Full Response Headers</li> <li>Full Response Body</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"cheatsheets/Virtual_Patching_Cheat_Sheet.html#identification-phase","title":"Identification Phase","text":"<p>The Identification Phase occurs when an organization becomes aware of a vulnerability within their web application.

Since this vulnerability is based on the core mechanism of modern web browsers, it's also called a browser side-channel attack. XS-Leaks attacks seek to exploit the fact of seemingly insignificant information that is exchanged in cross-site communications between sites. This information infers answers to the previously asked questions about the victim's user account. Please take a look at the examples provided below:</p> <ul> <li>Is the user currently logged in?</li> <li>Is the user ID 1337?</li> <li>Is the user an administrator?</li> <li>Does the user have a person with a particular email address in their contact list?</li> </ul> <p>On the basis of such questions, the attacker might try to deduce the answers, depending on the application's context. In most cases, the answers will be in binary form (yes or no). The impact of this vulnerability depends strongly on the application's risk profile.
