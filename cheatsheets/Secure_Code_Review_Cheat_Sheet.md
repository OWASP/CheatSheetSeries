# Secure Code Review Cheat Sheet

## Introduction

**Secure Code Review** is the process of manually examining source code to identify security vulnerabilities that automated tools often miss. It involves analyzing application logic, data flow, and implementation details to detect security flaws that require human expertise and contextual understanding.

**Manual Code Review** complements automated security testing tools (SAST/DAST) by focusing on areas where human analysis provides the most value, including business logic validation, complex security implementations, and context-specific vulnerabilities. While automated tools can assist by highlighting potential areas of concern, the core analysis relies on human judgment and domain expertise.

**Security-Focused Review** differs from functional code review by specifically targeting security concerns such as input validation, authentication mechanisms, authorization controls, cryptographic implementations, and potential attack vectors.

### Review Types

**Baseline Reviews** examine the entire codebase comprehensively. Use for:

- New applications or major releases
- Legacy system onboarding
- Compliance requirements
- Post-incident analysis

**Diff-Based Reviews** focus on code changes only. Use for:

- Pull requests and commits
- Daily development workflow
- Feature completion
- Continuous security validation

This cheat sheet provides practical guidance for conducting effective manual security code reviews, with emphasis on both baseline and incremental review methodologies.

## Review Methodology

### Preparation
