Title: Add File Upload and Local File Inclusion Cheat Sheet

Description:
This PR adds a new cheat sheet: "File Upload and Local File Inclusion Cheat Sheet" to the `cheatsheets/` directory.

Summary of changes
- Adds `cheatsheets/File_Upload_and_Local_File_Inclusion_Cheat_Sheet.md` — a combined, detailed guide covering:
  - secure file upload practices and server-side validation
  - common bypasses (extension, MIME, magic bytes, polyglots)
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack techniques and PHP wrapper exploitation
  - LFI -> RCE workflows (log/session poisoning, php://input, data://, etc.)
  - server & application hardening recommendations (php.ini, webserver configs)
  - detection/monitoring and incident response checklists

Why this change
- Provides thorough guidance for developers, operators, and security teams on both preventing and testing file-upload and LFI risks. It complements the existing `File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.md` by adding deeper LFI testing, exploitation examples, and remediation patterns.

Notes for reviewers
- There is some overlap with `cheatsheets/File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.md`; please advise if maintainers prefer:
  - keeping both files (separate concerns: upload vs. LFI),
  - merging LFI sections into the existing File_Upload cheat sheet, or
  - refactoring to remove duplicated material and keep one canonical guide.
- I did a quick scan for obvious secrets and none were found, but please run CI and a secrets check in your review flow.
- If you prefer the content split differently (shorter cheat sheet + companion LFI doc), I can refactor as requested.
