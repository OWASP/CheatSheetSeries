## Introduction

Provide high level information about the topic in order to introduce it to people that do not know it.

You can add pointer to external sources if needed but at least give an overview allowing a reader to continue on the CS.

You can also add schema or diagram in any part of the CS but be sure to respect the copyright of the source file.

## Main Sections

The main sections will vary based on the content of the cheat sheet. Generally there should be no more than half a dozen level 2 sections in the cheat sheet, with subsections created for these as required.

## References

Any useful references to other useful resources that aren't linked inline elsewhere in the cheat sheet.
