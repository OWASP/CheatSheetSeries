# CISA Secure by Design Cheat Sheet

## Introduction

This cheat sheet provides practical guidance for implementing the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) Secure by Design principles in software development. These principles encourage technology manufacturers to prioritize security throughout the product lifecycle.

## Principles and Practical Guidance

### 1. Take Ownership of Customer Security Outcomes

**Key Actions:**

- **Security Defaults**: Enable security features by default
- **Vulnerability Management**: Establish transparent patching processes
- **Incident Response**: Develop clear communication protocols for security incidents

### 2. Embrace Radical Transparency and Accountability

**Key Actions:**

- **Documentation**: Provide clear security documentation
- **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Establish accessible reporting channels
- **Metrics**: Publicly share security improvement metrics

### 3. Build Organizational Structure and Leadership to Achieve These Goals

**Key Actions:**

- **Executive Commitment**: Ensure C-level ownership of security
- **Cross-functional Teams**: Create teams with both development and security expertise
- **Security Training**: Provide ongoing security education for all developers

## Additional Security Practices

### Secure Development Lifecycle

- **Threat Modeling**: Integrate threat modeling throughout development
- **Secure Coding**: Implement coding standards and static analysis
- **Testing**: Conduct regular security testing and code reviews

### Memory Safety

- **Language Selection**: Prioritize memory-safe languages for new projects
- **Migration Planning**: Develop plans to transition existing codebases
- **Compilation Flags**: Use security-enhanced compilation options

### Security Architecture

- **Defense in Depth**: Design systems with security boundaries
- **Least Privilege**: Implement principle of least privilege throughout
- **Isolation**: Use process separation and sandboxing techniques

### Automation

- **CI/CD Integration**: Embed security testing in deployment pipelines
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
- **Remediation**: Automate patch deployment where possible
