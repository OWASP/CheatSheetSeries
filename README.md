## Reference to the Cheat Sheets

When a reference to a cheat sheet needs to be created, then a link pointing to the project (generated) official web site hosted on **https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org** must be used.

:triangular_flag_on_post: Markdown files are the working sources and are not intended to be referenced in any external documentation/book/website/etc.

## Cheat Sheets index

The following indexes are provided:
* This [index](Index.md) references all released cheat sheets sorted alphabetically.
    * This index is automatically generated by this [script](scripts/Update_CheatSheets_Index.py).
* This [index](IndexASVS.md) references all released cheat sheets using the [OWASP ASVS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project) project as reading source.
    * This index is manually managed in order to allow contribution along with custom content.
* This [index](IndexProactiveControls.md) references all released cheat sheets using the [OWASP Proactive Controls](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Proactive_Controls) project as the reading source.
    * This index is manually managed in order to allow contribution along with custom content.

The official website provides a search bar (top left corner) that can be used.

## Project Logo

The project's official logo files are hosted [here](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-swag/tree/master/projects/cheat-sheet-series).

## Folders

**cheatsheets_excluded**:
* Contains the cheat sheets markdown files converted with PANDOC. Before inclusion into V2 of this project, a discussion must occur to decide if this content is still relevant, as it has not been recently updated. See this [discussion](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/issues/13). 

**cheatsheets**: 
* Contains the final cheat sheets files. 
* Any `.md` file present in this folder is considered released.

**assets**: 
* Contains the assets used by the cheat sheets (images, PDF's, ZIP files etc.).
    * Naming convention is `[CHEAT_SHEET_MARKDOWN_FILE_NAME]_[IDENTIFIER].[EXTENSION]`
    * Use `PNG` format for the images.

**scripts**:
* Contains all the utility scripts used to operate the project (markdown linter audit, dead link identification etc.).    

**templates**:
* Contains templates used for different kinds of files (cheatsheets etc.).

**.github**:
* Contains materials used to configure different behaviors of GitHub.

**.circleci** / **.travis.yml** (file):
* Contains the definition of the integration jobs used to control the integrity and consistency of the whole project:
    * **[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries)** is used to perform compliance check actions at each Push/Pull Request. **It must be/stay the fastest possible** (currently inferior to 2 minutes) in order to provide a rapid compliance feedback about the Push/Pull Request.
    * **[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries)** is used to perform operations taking *longer time* like build, publish and deploy actions.

## Offline Website

Unfortunately, a PDF file generation is not possible because the content is cut in some cheat sheets, for example, the abuse case one.

However, to propose the possibility the consult, in a full offline mode, the collection of all cheat sheets, a script to generate an offline site using [GitBook](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/) has been created. The script is [here](scripts/Generate_Site.sh).

* **book.json**: Gitbook configuration file.
* **Preface.md**: Project preface description applied to the generated site.

:information_source: It is this generated content that is hosted on the [official web site](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org) of the project.

### Automated Build

This [link](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/bundle.zip) allows you to download a build (ZIP archive) of the offline website.

### Manual Build

Use the commands below to generate the site:

```bash
# Your python version must be >= 3.5
$ python --version
Python 3.5.3
# Dependencies:
#  sudo apt install -y nodejs
#  sudo npm install gitbook-cli -g
$ cd scripts
$ bash Generate_Site.sh
Generate a offline portable website with all the cheat sheets...
Step 1/5: Init work folder.
Step 2/5: Generate the summary markdown page.
Index updated.
Summary markdown page generated.
Step 3/5: Create the expected GitBook folder structure.
Step 4/5: Generate the site.
info: found 45 pages
info: found 86 asset files
info: >> generation finished with success in 14.2s !
Step 5/5: Cleanup.
Generation finished to the folder: ../generated/site
$ cd ../generated/site/
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 1 Feb  3 11:05 assets
drwxr-xr-x 1 Feb  3 11:05 cheatsheets
drwxr-xr-x 1 Feb  3 11:05 gitbook
-rw-r--r-- 1 Feb  3 11:05 index.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 Feb  3 11:05 search_index.json
```

## Conversion Rules

* Use the markdown syntax described in this [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
* Use this [sheet](https://gist.github.com/molomby/9bc092e4a125f529ae362de7e46e8176) for superscript and subscript characters.
* Use this [sheet](https://meta.askubuntu.com/a/7383) for arrows (left, right, top, down) characters.
* Store all assets in the **assets** folder and use the following syntax:
    * `![ALTERNATE_NAME](../assets/ASSET_NAME.png)` for the insertion of an image. Use `PNG` format for the images (this [software](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) can be used to handle format conversion).
    * `[ALTERNATE_NAME](../assets/ASSET_NAME.EXT)` for the insertion of other kinds of media (PDF, ZIP etc.).
* Use ATX style (`#` syntax) for section head. 
* Use `**bold**` syntax for **bold** text.
* Use `*italic*` syntax for *italic* text.
* Use `TAB` for nested lists and not spaces.
* Use [code fencing syntax along syntax highlighting](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for code snippet (prevent when possible horizontal scrollbar).
* If you use `{{` or `}}` pattern in code fencing then add a space between both curly braces (ex: `{ {`) otherwise it will break the GitBook generation process.
* Same remark about the cheat sheet file name, only the following syntax is allowed: `[a-zA-Z_]+`.
* No HTML code is allowed, only markdown syntax is allowed.
* Use this [site](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) for generation of tables.
* Use a single new line between a section head and the beginning of its content.

## Editor & validation policy

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is used for the work on the markdown files. It is also used for the work on the scripts.

The file **Project.code-workspace** is the workspace file in order to open the project in VSCode.

The following [plugin](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint) is used to validate the markdown content.

The file **.markdownlint.json** defines the central validation policy applied at VSCode (IDE) and TravisCI (CI) levels.

Details about rules can be found [here](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/master/doc/Rules.md).

The file **.markdownlinkcheck.json** defines the configuration used to validate using this [tool](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check), at TravisCI level, all web and relatives links used in cheat sheets.
