Welcome to the official repository for the Open Web Application Security Project® (OWASP) Cheat Sheet Series project. The project focuses on providing good security practices for builders in order to secure their applications.

In order to read the cheat sheets and **reference** them, use the project's [official website](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org). The project details can be viewed on the [OWASP main website](https://owasp.org/www-project-cheat-sheets/) without the cheat sheets.
