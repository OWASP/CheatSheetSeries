After an exchange with the leaders of the [OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg) project, it was decided to replace the content of this cheat sheet by a reference to the dedicated content on the MSTG project.

The explanation is simple:

1.  It's an OWASP project too.
2.  The MSTG project is active.
3.  It focus on Android and iOS areas.
4.  It provides good and up-to-date advices about how to handle mobile threats for the both platforms.
5.  MSTG content came from various specialists in the mobile domain.

Consult this [section](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg#android-testing-guide) for information about ANDROID platform.
