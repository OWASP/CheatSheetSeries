# CISA Secure by Design Cheat Sheet

## Introduction
This cheat sheet summarizes the key principles from the **CISA Secure by Design** guidance, helping developers and organizations build secure software from the start.

## Core Principles

### 1. Take Ownership of Security Outcomes
Vendors must take responsibility for customer security outcomes, ensuring defaults are safe and vulnerabilities are minimized.

### 2. Embrace Transparency and Accountability
Clearly document security decisions, publish vulnerabilities, and share SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials).

### 3. Lead with Secure by Design Practices
Embed security considerations into every phase of development, not as an afterthought.

## Implementation Best Practices
- Conduct **threat modeling** early in development.  
- Use **multi-factor authentication** and **least privilege access**.  
- Apply **memory-safe languages** where possible.  
- Provide **secure configurations by default**.  
- Maintain a clear **vulnerability disclosure program**.
