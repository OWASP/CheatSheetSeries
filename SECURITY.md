# Security Policy

The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series is primarily documentation, but some in-scope examples include:

- Allows an attacker to run code in a readerâ€™s browser via [our site](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/) (XSS, open redirect, etc)
- Leaks GitHub Actions secrets
- Tampers with our build pipeline

Example snippets that are intentionally vulnerable for demonstration are out of scope unless they can be exploited on the live site.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open public issues for new vulnerabilities**.

Instead, submit a private report including clear steps to reproduce and details about potential impact to:

- jim.manico@owasp.org
- jakub.mackowski@owasp.org
