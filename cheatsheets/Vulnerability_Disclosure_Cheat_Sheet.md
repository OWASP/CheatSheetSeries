# Vulnerability Disclosure Cheat Sheet

## Introduction

This cheat sheet is intended to provide guidance on the vulnerability disclosure process for both security researchers and organisations. This is an area where collaboration is extremely important, but that can often result in conflict between the two parties.

**Researchers should:**

- Ensure that any testing is legal and authorised.
- Respect the privacy of others.
- Make reasonable efforts to contact the security team of the organisation.
- Provide sufficient details to allow the vulnerabilities to be verified and reproduced.
- Request CVEs where appropriate.
- Not demand payment or rewards for reporting vulnerabilities outside of an established bug bounty program.

**Organisations should:**

- Provide a clear method for researchers to securely report vulnerabilities.
- Clearly establish the scope and terms of any bug bounty programs.
- Respond to reports in a reasonable timeline.
- Communicate openly with researchers.
- Not threaten legal action against researchers.
- Offer rewards and credit.

## Contents

There are a number of different models that can be be followed when disclosing vulnerabilities.

# Methods of Disclosure

## Private Disclosure

In the private disclosure model, the vulnerability is reported privately to the organisation. The organisation may choose to publish the details of the vulnerabilities, but this is done at the discretion of the organisation, not the researcher, meaning that many vulnerabilities may never be made public. The majority of bug bounty programs require that the researcher follows this model.

The main problem with this model is that if the vendor is unresponsive, or decides not to fix the vulnerability, then the details may never be made public. Historically this has lead to researchers getting fed up with companies ignoring and trying to hide vulnerabilities, leading them to the full disclosure approach.

## Full Disclosure

With the full disclosure approach, the full details of the vulnerability are made public as soon as they are identified. This avoids the problem of organisations ignoring vulnerabilities, however it also means that the full details (sometimes including exploit code) are available to attackers, often before a patch is available.

This makes the full disclosure approach very controversial, and it is seen as irresponsible by many people. Generally it should only be considered as a last resort, when all other methods have failed, or when exploit code is already publicly available.

## Responsible or Coordinated Disclosure

Responsible disclosure attempts to find a reasonable middle ground between these two approaches. With responsible disclosure, the initial report is made privately, but with the full details being published once a patch has been made available (sometimes with a delay to allow more time for the patches to be installed).

In many cases, the researcher also provides a deadline for the organisation to respond to the report, or to provide a patch. If this deadline is not met, then the researcher may adopt the full disclosure approach, and publish the full details.

Google's [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/01/policy-and-disclosure-2020-edition.html) adopts a similar approach, where the full details of the vulnerability are published after 90 days regardless of whether or not the organisation has published a patch.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

This section is intended to provide guidance for security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities to organisations.

### Warnings and Legality

Before carrying out any security research or reporting vulnerabilities, **ensure that you know and understand the laws in your jurisdiction**. This cheat sheet **does not constitute legal advice, and should not be taken as such.**.

The following points highlight a number of areas that should be considered:

- If you are carrying out testing under a bug bounty or similar program, the organisation may have established [safe harbor](https://disclose.io) policies, that allow you to legally carry out testing, **as long as you stay within the scope and rules of their program**. Make sure that you read the scope carefully - stepping outside of the scope and rules may be a criminal offence.
- Some countries have laws restricting reverse engineering, so testing against locally installed software may not be permitted.
- Do not demand payment or other rewards as a condition of providing information on security vulnerabilities, or in exchange for not publishing the details or reporting them to industry regulators, as this may constitute blackmail.
- If you receive bug bounty payments, these are generally considered as income, meaning that they may be taxable. Reporting this income and ensuring that you pay the appropriate tax on it is **your** responsibility.
- If you find vulnerabilities as part of your work, or on equipment owned by your employer, your employer may prevent you from reporting these or claiming a bug bounty. Read your contract carefully and consider taking legal advice before doing so.

### Finding Contact Details

The first step in reporting a vulnerability is finding the appropriate person to report it to. Although some organisations have clearly published disclosure policies, many do not, so it can be difficult to find the correct place to report the issue.

Where there is no clear disclosure policy, the following areas may provide contact details:

- Bug bounty programs such as [BugCrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/programs),  [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/directory/programs) or [Open Bug Bounty](https://www.openbugbounty.org).
- A [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org) file on the website at `/security.txt` or `/.well-known/security.txt`.
- An existing issue tracking system.
- Generic email addresses such as `security@` or `abuse@`.
- The generic "Contact Us" page on the website.
- Social media platforms.
- Phoning the organisation.
- Reaching out to the community.

When reaching out to people who are not dedicated security contacts, request the details for a relevant member of staff, rather than disclosing the vulnerability details to whoever accepts the initial contact (especially over social media).

If it is not possible to contact the organisation directly, a national or sector-based  [CERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_emergency_response_team) may be able to assist.

### Initial Report

Once a security contact has been identified, an initial report should be made of the details of the vulnerability. Ideally this should be done over an encrypted channel (such as the use of PGP keys), although many organisations do not support this.

The initial report should include:

- Sufficient details of the vulnerability to allow it to be understood and reproduced.
- HTML snippets, screenshots or any other supporting evidence.
  + Redact any personal data before reporting.
- Proof of concept code (if available).
- The impact of the vulnerability.
- Any references or further reading that may be appropriate.

In many cases, especially in smaller organisations, the security reports may be handled by developers or IT staff who do not have a security background. This means that they may not be familiar with many security concepts or terminology, so reports should be written in clear and simple terms.

It may also be beneficial to provide a recommendation on how the issue could be mitigated or resolved. However, unless the details of the system or application are known, or you are very confident in the recommendation then it may be better to point the developers to some more general guidance (such as an OWASP cheat sheet).

If you are planning to publish the details of the vulnerability after a period of time (as per some [responsible disclosure](#responsible-or-coordinated-disclosure) policies), then this should be clearly communicated in the initial email - but try to do so in a tone that doesn't sound threatening to the recipient.

If the organisation does not have an established bug bounty program, then avoid asking about payments or rewards in the initial contact - leave it until the issue has been acknowledged (or ideally fixed). In particular, **do not demand payment before revealing the details of the vulnerability**. At best this will look like an attempt to scam the company, at worst it may constitute blackmail.

### Ongoing Communication

While simpler vulnerabilities might be resolved solely from the initial report, in many cases there will be a number of emails back and forth between the researcher and the organisation. Especially for more complex vulnerabilities, the the developers or administrators may ask for additional information or recommendations on how to resolve the issue. They may also ask for assistance in retesting the issue once a fix has been implemented. Although there is no obligation to carry out this retesting, as long as the request is reasonable then and providing feedback on the fixes is very beneficial.

It may also be necessary to chase up the organisation if they become unresponsive, or if the established deadline for publicly disclosing the vulnerability is approaching. Ensure that this communication stays professional and positive - if the disclosure process becomes hostile then neither party will benefit.

Be patient if it's taking a while for the issue to be resolved. The developers may be under significant pressure from different people within the organisation, and may not be able to be fully open in their communication. Triaging, developing, reviewing, testing and deploying a fix within in an enterprise environment takes **significantly** more time than most researchers expect, and being constantly hassled for updates just adds another level of pressure on the developers.

### When to Give Up

Despite every effort that you make, some organisations are not interested in in security, are impossible to contact, may may be actively hostile to researchers disclosing vulnerabilities. In some cases they may even threaten to take legal action against researchers. When this happens it is very disheartening for the researcher - it is important not to take this personally. When this happens, there are a number of options that can be taken.

- Publicly disclose the vulnerability, and deal with any negative reaction and potentially even a lawsuit. Whether or not they have a strong legal case is irrelevant - they have expensive lawyers and fighting any kind of legal action is expensive and time consuming. Before going down this route, ask yourself _it really worth it?_
- Anonymously disclose the vulnerability. However, if you're already made contact with the organisation and tried to report the vulnerability, it may be pretty obvious who you are.
- Report the vulnerability to a third party, such as an industry regulator or data protection authority.
- Move on.

There are many organisations who have a genuine interest in security, and are very open and co-operative with security researchers. Unless the vulnerability is extremely serious, **it is not worth burning yourself out, or risking your career and livelihood over and organisation who doesn't care**.

### Publishing

Once a vulnerability has been patched (or not), then a decision needs to be made about publishing the details. This should ideally be done through discussion with the vendor, and at a minimum the vendor should be notified that you intend to publish, and provided with a link to the published details. The disclosure would typically include:

- A high level summary of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Details of which version(s) are vulnerable, and which are fixed.
- Technical details or potentially proof of concept code.
- Mitigations or workarounds.
- Links to the vendor's published advisory.
- The timeline for the discovery, vendor communication and release.

Some organisations may request that you do not publish the details are all, or that you delay publication to allow more time to their users to install security patches. In the interest of maintaining a positive relationship with the organisation, it is worth trying to find a compromise position on this.

Whether to publish working proof of concept (or functional exploit code) is a subject of debate. Some people will view this as a "blackhat" move, and will argue that by doing so you are directly helping criminals compromise their users. On the other hand, the code can be used to both system administrators and penetration testers to test their systems, and attackers will be able to develop or reverse engineering working exploit code if the vulnerability is sufficiently valuable.

If you are publishing the details in hostile circumstances (such as an unresponsive organisation, or after a stated period of time has elapsed) then you may face threats and even legal action. Whether there is any legal basis for this will depend on your jurisdiction, and whether you signed any form of non-disclosure agreement with the organisation. Make sure you understand your legal position before doing so.

Note that many bug bounty programs forbid researchers from publishing the details without the agreement of the organisation. If you choose to do so, you may forfeit the bounty or be banned from the platform - so read the rules of the program before publishing.

## Receiving Vulnerability Reports
