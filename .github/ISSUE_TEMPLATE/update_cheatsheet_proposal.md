Thank you for proposing to update/refactor one of our cheat sheets.

Please provide the following information about your proposal:

1. What is missing or needs to be updated in the current iteration of the cheat sheet?
2. How do you intend to resolve this with an update/refactoring?

Thank you again for your contribution :smiley:
