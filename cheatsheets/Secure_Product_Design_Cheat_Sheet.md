# Secure Product Design Cheat Sheet

## Overview

Secure Product Design ensures that security is integrated into the design phase of software development. This reduces vulnerabilities and protects user data.

## Principles

- **Least Privilege:** Limit access rights for users, accounts, and processes.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults:** Default configurations should be secure.
- **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- **Economy of Mechanism:** Keep design as simple and small as possible.
- **Complete Mediation:** Check permissions for every access.
- **Open Design:** Security should not depend on secrecy of design.
- **Separation of Duties:** Divide responsibilities to reduce risk.
- **Least Common Mechanism:** Minimize sharing of resources among users.
- **Psychological Acceptability:** Security measures should be user-friendly.

## Secure Design Steps

1. **Threat Modeling**
   
   - Identify assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
   - Use STRIDE or PASTA methodologies.

2. **Security Requirements**
   
   - Define security goals.
   - Map requirements to functionality.

3. **Architecture Design**
   
   - Use secure patterns (e.g., MVC, layered architecture).
   - Apply secure communication protocols (TLS, HTTPS).

4. **Design Review**
   
   - Conduct peer and expert reviews.
   - Use checklists based on OWASP and CISA guidelines.

5. **Implementation Guidelines**
   
   - Use secure coding standards.
   - Validate all inputs.
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

## Security Controls

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  
  - Multi-factor authentication.
  - Role-based access control (RBAC).

- **Data Protection**
  
  - Encrypt sensitive information.
  - Use secure storage mechanisms.

- **Error Handling**
  
  - Do not reveal sensitive information in error messages.
  - Log errors securely.

- **Session Management**
  
  - Use secure, HTTP-only cookies.
  - Implement session timeout.

- **Logging & Monitoring**
  
  - Centralize logs.
  - Monitor for suspicious activity.
