# Application Logging Vocabulary Cheat Sheet

This document proposes a standard vocabulary for logging security events. The intent is to simplify monitoring and alerting such that, assuming developers trap errors and log them using this vocabulary, monitoring and alerting would be improved by simply keying on these terms.

## Overview

Each year IBM Security commissions the Ponemon Institute to survey companies around the world for information related to security breaches, mitigation, and the associated costs; the result is called the Cost of a Data Breach Report.

In addition to the millions of dollars lost due to breaches the report finds that the **mean time to identify** a breach continues to hover around **200 days**. Clearly our ability to monitor applications and alert on anomalous behavior would improve our time to identify and mitigate an attack against our applications.

> IBM Cost of a Data Breach Study 2020, Fig.34, pg.52, [https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach]

This logging standard would seek to define specific keywords which, when applied consistently across software, would allow groups to simply monitor for these events terms across all applications and respond quickly in the event of attack.

## Assumptions

- Observability/SRE groups must support the use of this standard and encourage developers to use it
- Incident Response must either ingest this data OR provide a means by which other monitoring teams can send a notification of alert, preferably programmatically.
- Architects must support, adopt, and contribute to this standard
- Developers must embrace this standard and begin to implement (requires knowledge and intent to understand potential attacks and trap those errors in code).

## Getting Started

As a reminder, the goal of logging is to be able to alert on specific security events. Of course, the first step to logging these events is good error handling, if you're not trapping the events, you don't have an event to log.

### Identifying Events

In order to better understand security event logging a good high-level understanding of threat modeling would be helpful, even if it's a simple approach of:

1. **What could go wrong?**

- Orders: could someone order on behalf of another?
- Authentication: could I log in as someone else?
- Authorization: could I see someone else' account?

2. **What would happen if it did?**

- Orders: I've placed an order on behalf of another... to an abandoned warehouse in New Jersey. Oops.
- Then I bragged about it on 4Chan.
- Then I told the New York Times about it.

3. **Who might intend to do this?**

- Intentional attacks by hackers.
- An employee "testing" how things work.
- An API coded incorrectly doing things the author did not intend.

## Format

_NOTE: All dates should be logged in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format **WITH** UTC offset to ensure maximum portability_

```
{
    "datetime": "2021-01-01T01:01:01-0700",
    "appid": "foobar.netportal_auth",
    "event": "AUTHN_login_success:joebob1",
    "level": "INFO",
    "description": "User joebob1 login successfully",
    "useragent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.108 Safari/537.36",
    "source_ip": "165.225.50.94",

    "request_uri": "/api/v2/auth/",
    "request_method": "POST",
    "region": "AWS-US-WEST-2",
    "geo": "USA"
}
```

## The Vocabulary

What follows are the various event types that should be captured. For each event type there is a prefix like "authn" and additional data that should be included for that event.

Portions of the full logging format are included for example, but a complete event log should follow the format above.

    ...
}
```

---

### upload_stored[filename,from,to]

**Description**
One step in good file upload validation is to move/rename the file and when providing the content back to end users, never reference the original filename in the download. This is true both when storing in a filesystem as well as in block storage.

**Level:**: INFO

**Example:**

```
{
    "datetime": "2019-01-01 00:00:00,000",
    "appid": "foobar.netportal_auth",
    "event": "upload_stored:user_generated_content.png,kjsdhkrjhwijhsiuhdf000010202002",

    "description": "File user_generated_content.png was stored in the database with key abcdefghijk101010101",
    ...
}
```

---

### upload_validation[filename,(virusscan|imagemagick|...):(FAILED|incomplete|passed)]

**Level:**: INFO|CRITICAL

**Example:**

```
{

    "level": "INFO",
    "description": "User joebob1 has marked file abcdefghijk101010101 for deletion.",
    ...
}
```

---

## Input Validation [INPUT]

### input_validation_fail[:field,userid]

**Description**
When input validation fails on the server-side it must either be because a) sufficient validation was not provided on the client, or b) client-side validation was bypassed. In either case it's an opportunity for attack and should be mitigated quickly.

**Level:**
WARN

```
{
    "datetime": "2019-01-01 00:00:00,000",
    "appid": "foobar.netportal_auth",

```

---

## Malicious Behavior [MALICIOUS

### malicious_excess_404:[userid|IP,useragent]

**Description**
When a user makes numerous requests for files that don't exist it often is an indicator of attempts to "force-browse" for files that could exist and is often behavior indicating malicious intent.

**Level:**
WARN

**Example:**

```
{
    "datetime": "2019-01-01 00:00:00,000",
    "appid": "foobar.netportal_auth",

    "level": "WARN",
    "description": "A user at 123.456.789.101 has generated a large number of 404 requests.",
    ...
}
```

---

### malicious_extraneous:[userid|IP,inputname,useragent]

**Description**
When a user submits data to a backend handler that was not expected it can indicate probing for input validation errors. If your backend service receives data it does not handle or have an input for this is an indication of likely malicious abuse.

**Level:**
CRITICAL

**Example:**

```
{
    "datetime": "2019-01-01 00:00:00,000",
    "appid": "foobar.netportal_auth",
    "event": "malicious_extraneous:dr@evil.com,creditcardnum,Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0",
    "level": "WARN",
    "description": "User dr@evil.com included field creditcardnum in the request which is not handled by this service.",
    ...
}
```

---

### malicious_attack_tool:[userid|IP,toolname,useragent]

**Description**
When obvious attack tools are identified either by signature or by user agent they should be logged.

**TODO:** A future version of this standard should link to known attack tools, signatures and user-agent strings. For instance, the tool "Nikto" leaves behind its user agent by default with a string like **_"Mozilla/5.00 (Nikto/2.1.6) (Evasions:None) (Test:Port Check)"_**

**Level:**
CRITICAL

**Example:**

```
{
    "datetime": "2019-01-01 00:00:00,000",
    "appid": "foobar.netportal_auth",
    "event": "malicious_attack_tool:127.0.0.1,nikto,Mozilla/5.00 (Nikto/2.1.6) (Evasions:None) (Test:Port Check)",
    "level": "WARN",
    "description": "Attack traffic indicating use of Nikto coming from 127.0.0.1",
    ...
}
```

---

### malicious_cors:[userid|IP,useragent,referer]

**Description**
When attempts are made from unauthorized origins they should of course be blocked, but also logged whenever possible. Even if we block an illegal cross-origin request the fact that the request is being made could be an indication of attack.

_NOTE: Did you know that the word "referer" is misspelled in the original HTTP specification? The correct spelling should be "referrer" but the original typo persists to this day and is used here intentionally._

**Level:**
CRITICAL

**Example:**

```
{
    "datetime": "2019-01-01 00:00:00,000",
    "appid": "foobar.netportal_auth",
    "event": "malicious_cors:127.0.0.1,Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0,attack.evil.com",
    "level": "WARN",
    "description": "An illegal cross-origin request from 127.0.0.1 was referred from attack.evil.com"
    ...
}
```

---

### malicious_direct_reference:[userid|IP, useragent]

**Description**
A common attack against authentication and authorization is to directly access an object without credentials or appropriate access authority. Failing to prevent this flaw used to be one of the OWASP Top Ten called **Insecure Direct Object Reference**. Assuming you've correctly prevented this attack, logging the attempt is valuable to identify malicious users.

**Level:**
CRITICAL

**Example:**

```
{
    "datetime": "2019-01-01 00:00:00,000",
    "appid": "foobar.netportal_auth",
    "event": "malicious_direct:joebob1, Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0",
    "level": "WARN",
    "description": "User joebob1 attempted to access an object to which they are not authorized",
    ...
}
```

---

## Privilege Changes [PRIVILEGE]

This section focuses on object privilege changes such as read/write/execute permissions or objects in a database having authorization meta-information changed.

Changes to user/account are covered in the User Management section.

---

### privilege_permissions_changed:[userid,file|object,fromlevel,tolevel]

**Description**
Tracking changes to objects to which there are access control restrictions can uncover attempt to escalate privilege on those files by unauthorized users.

**Level:**
WARN

**Example:**

```
{
    "datetime": "2019-01-01 00:00:00,000",
    "appid": "foobar.netportal_auth",
    "event": "malicious_direct:joebob1, /users/admin/some/important/path,0511,0777",
    "level": "WARN",
    "description": "User joebob1 changed permissions on /users/admin/some/important/path",
    ...
}
```

---

## Sensitive Data Changes [DATA]

It's not necessary to log or alert on changes to all files, but in the case of highly sensitive files or data it is important that we monitor and alert on changes.

---

### sensitive_create:[userid,file|object]

**Description**

    ...
}
```

---

## Sequence Errors [SEQUENCE]

Also called a **_business logic attack_**, if a specific path is expected through a system and an attempt is made to skip or change the order of that path it could indicate malicious intent.

---

### sequence_fail:[userid]

**Description**
