## Core Principles

### 1. Establish Secure Defaults
- Configure systems, frameworks, and libraries to be secure by default.  
- Avoid optional security features; defaults should minimize risk.  

### 2. Minimize Attack Surface
- Limit exposed APIs, endpoints, and interfaces.  
- Remove unnecessary functionality or permissions.  
- Follow the principle of least privilege.  

### 3. Fail Securely
- Design systems to handle errors safely.  
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.  
- Ensure failures do not weaken security controls.  

### 4. Ensure Transparency
- Maintain clear, documented design decisions regarding security.  
- Provide traceability for security-related changes.  
- Enable auditing where appropriate.  

### 5. Leadership Commitment
- Security should be supported at the organizational leadership level.  
- Decisions around design and architecture must consider long-term security implications.  

### 6. Foster a Security Culture
- Encourage security awareness throughout the development team.  
- Include security discussions in design reviews and planning.  
- Provide training and resources for secure coding and design practices.  

### 7. Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review design patterns and update them based on new threats.  
- Monitor product security in production and incorporate feedback into design.
