# Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet

## Threat Modeling Manifesto

We strongly recommend reading [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/) and use it as a threat modeling cheat sheet for applications. It is well written and maintained by threat modeling experts with years of experience in this subject.

For further study and learn more check out the linked resources at the bottom of the [Threat Modeling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/).

## What is a threat?

The [NIST definition of a cyber threat](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/threat) defines a threat as “Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service.”

## Making Threat Model Accessible to Developers

It is important to engage developers in threat modeling, since threat modeling is most useful as a collaborative effort (not just a process for only security professionals). Some ways to engage developers include:

The us of threat modeling card games, such as:
[Elevation of Privilege](https://github.com/adamshostack/eop/tree/master), which is based off of [STRIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security))
[LINDDUN GO](https://www.linddun.org/go), which is based off of the [LINDDUN privacy framework](https://www.linddun.org/linddun)
Threat modeling automation tools, such as [pytm](https://github.com/izar/pytm)
