# Secure Code Review Cheat Sheet

## Introduction

**Secure Code Review** is the process of manually examining source code to identify security vulnerabilities that automated tools often miss. It involves analyzing application logic, data flow, and implementation details to detect security flaws that require human expertise and contextual understanding.

**Manual Code Review** complements automated security testing tools (SAST/DAST) by focusing on areas where human analysis provides the most value, including business logic validation, complex security implementations, and context-specific vulnerabilities.

**Security-Focused Review** differs from functional code review by specifically targeting security concerns such as input validation, authentication mechanisms, authorization controls, cryptographic implementations, and potential attack vectors.

This cheat sheet provides practical guidance for conducting effective security code reviews, including methodologies, checklists, tools, and integration strategies for incorporating security reviews into the software development lifecycle.

## Review Methodology

### Preparation

Before starting the review:

- **Understand the Application**: Review architecture diagrams, data flow, and business requirements
- **Define Review Scope**: Specify boundaries (new code, changed files, or full application)
- **Gather Context**: Collect threat models, previous security findings, and compliance requirements
- **Identify Critical Assets**: Focus on sensitive data, high-risk functions, and external interfaces
- **Review Documentation**: Examine security requirements, design documents, and API specifications
- **Understand Attack Surface**: Map all entry points, APIs, and external integrations
- **Check Dependencies**: Review third-party libraries and their known vulnerabilities

### Review Process

Conduct the review in phases:

1. **Architecture Review**: Examine high-level design for security anti-patterns
2. **Entry Point Analysis**: Review all input vectors and validation mechanisms
3. **Authentication & Authorization**: Verify access controls and session management
4. **Data Flow Analysis**: Trace sensitive data through the application
5. **Business Logic Review**: Analyze workflows for logic flaws and race conditions
6. **Cryptographic Review**: Check encryption, hashing, and key management
7. **Error Handling**: Verify proper error handling and information disclosure prevention
8. **Configuration Review**: Check security configurations and deployment settings

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

### Input Validation Vulnerabilities

Check for missing server-side validation, improper sanitization, and weak input filtering. For more information, see [Input Validation Cheat Sheet](Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.md).

### Injection Vulnerabilities

**SQL Injection:**

Look for string concatenation in database queries and unsafe query construction. For more information, see [SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md).

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

Review output encoding, DOM manipulation, and user input rendering. For more information, see [Cross Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet](Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md).

**Path Traversal:**

Check for unsafe file path construction and directory traversal vulnerabilities. For more information, see [File Upload Cheat Sheet](File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.md).
