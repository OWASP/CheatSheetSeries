# How to contribute?

**Notes:** 
* Regarding fixing of a typo in existing cheat sheet, you can directly create a Pull Request otherwise follow the process below.
* :heavy_exclamation_mark: Focus on updating a single file by Pull Request to facilitate the review by the core team.
* :warning: Pull Request marked as **WAITING_UPDATE** (indicate that the core team wait an update from the author of the Pull Request) that do not receive any update from the author in a timeframe superior to one month then will be closed.
* :warning: If the assignees of an issue do not provide any Pull Request in a timeframe superior to one month then the issue will go back to the **HELP_WANTED** state and assignees will be removed.

Follow these steps:

1. Create an new [Issue](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/issues/new/choose) using either:
   - The `new_cheatsheet_proposal` template if you want to propose a new cheat sheet.
   - The `update_cheatsheet_proposal` template if you want to modify a existing cheat sheet.
2. After a discussion on the topic/update and if the proposal is accepted by the project leaders then:
    1. Clone this GitHub repository.
    2. Either:
      - Create the cheat sheet using the dedicated [template](templates/New_CheatSheet.md) in case of a new cheat sheet.
      - Modify the target cheat sheet in case of a update/refactoring.
    3. Submit your [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
    4. Verify that the CI job [applied on your Pull Request](https://travis-ci.org/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/pull_requests) do not fail!

# Content Guidelines

The intended audience of the cheat sheets is developers, _not_ security experts. As such, do not assume that the person reading the cheat sheet has a strong understanding of security topics. In depth or academic discussions are generally not appropriate in cheat sheets, and should be linked to as external references where appropriate.

The purpose of the cheat sheets is to provide **useful, practical advice** that can be followed by developers. It is much better to give _good_ practices that can actually be followed than _best_ practices that are completely impractical

When submitting changes in a PR, consider the following areas:

- The content should be useful to developers.
- The contents should be factual and correct.
- Statements should be supported by authoritative references where possible.
- Recommendations should be feasible for the majority of developers to implement.

# Style Guidelines

## Cheat Sheet Structure

- Start with a H1 of the cheat sheet name
- Generally the first two sections should be `Introduction` and `Contents`, followed by the body of the cheat sheet.
- Headings should have a blank line after them.

## Language

- Use US English.
  * Spell check before submitted a PR.
- Try and keep the language relatively simple to make it easier for non-native speakers
- Define any non-ubiquitous acronyms when they are first used.
  * This is not necessary for extremely common acronyms such as "HTTP" or "URL".

## Markdown Formatting

- Nested lists should use different characters for each level. The characters should be (in order), `-`, `*` and `+`.
- `**Bold**` and `_italic_` formatting can be used occasionally for emphasis.
- Links should be inline with a useful description, such as `[Description](https://example.org)`.
  * Always use HTTPS links where possible
- Quotes from other articles should use quote syntax: `> Quote here`
- Code snippets should be short and should be appropriately marked to provide syntax highlighting:

```md
    ```php
    <?php
    echo "Example code";
    ```
```

# How to setup my contributor environment?

Follow these steps:

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (named `VSCode` from here), it is cross platform and free.
2. Install this [plugin](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint#install) from VSCode.
3. Open the file [Project.code-workspace](Project.code-workspace) from VSCode via the menu `File > Open Workspace...`.
4. You are ready to contribute :+1:

:alarm_clock: Before to push my update to my fork, what I need to verify?

1. Ensure that the markdown file you have created/modified do not have any warnings/errors raised by the linter, you can see it in this bottom bar when the markdown file is opened in VSCode: 

![PluginWarningUI](assets/README_PluginWarningUI.png)

2. Ensure that the markdown file you have created/modified do not have any deadlinks. You can verify that by using this [plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-link-check), if you cannot use this plugin then, at least, verify that all the links are valid before to push:
    1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install NPM.
    2. Install the validation plugin via the command `npm install -g markdown-link-check`
    3. Use this command (from the repository root folder) on your markdown file to verify the presence of any deadlinks: 

```bash
$ markdown-link-check -c .markdownlinkcheck.json [MD_FILE]
```

See the example below:

```bash
$ markdown-link-check -c .markdownlinkcheck.json cheatsheets/Transaction_Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.md
FILE: cheatsheets/Transaction_Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.md

# If the program do not say to you that you have deadlinks so it's OK
# The identified deadlinks are showed using a red cross instead of a green tick before the link.
